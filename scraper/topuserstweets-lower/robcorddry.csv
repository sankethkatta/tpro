robcorddry,Listening to Destroyer and cleaning out the refrigerator. An ideal Saturday morning.
robcorddry,The only way to teach Leta about diversity in Utah is by taking her to the liquor store.
robcorddry,Either these pants shrunk in the wash or I suddenly grew a butt.
robcorddry,"Leta's latest attempt at an insult: ""I'm not caring about you!"""
robcorddry,First day of the year with temperatures in the 70s and people are walking around in bikinis.
robcorddry,Mormon-owned newspaper coming over to the house. Better hide my collection of Noam Chomsky.

robcorddry,OH MY GOD. Memphis. MEMPHIS!
robcorddry,GO MEMPHIS!

robcorddry,"Jon: There is a huge Chinese population in China. Me: Who would  have guessed! Jon: I mean, San Francisco, oh shut up MISS CRAYOLA CROWN."
robcorddry,I didn't want to but they forced me to say poop on live TV. I can feel Maggie gagging from here.
robcorddry,"Hoping I can sneak out of the house quietly enough that Bo doesn't hear me, ROO! unexpectedly and wake Jon up with a seizure. Tippy-toes!"
robcorddry,"Tomorrow morning I'm going to be on the local news, and I can't decide whether or not I should wear any pants."
robcorddry,"If you're not delighting in the fact that everything is staged, then you're missing the whole point of reality programming."
robcorddry,You go right ahead and exercise your demons. But you might want to take it a step further and ask them to cut back on carbs.
robcorddry,"To answer your question, no, I do not think that a dog who poops in a moving vehicle is a _smart_ animal."
robcorddry,"Leta: ""Mom? When we get to the library can I take my pants off?"""

robcorddry,"Made too much of a fuss over Leta's hair because she suddenly stomped into her room, slammed the door and yelled UGH! I NEED SOME SPACE!"
robcorddry,The ring tone on my iPhone is set to the sound of a dog barking to signal when Jon is calling. Coco does not appreciate this feature.
robcorddry,Leta: How many do I have to eat? Me: 10. Leta: How about 8? Me: 10. Leta: How about 5? Me: You're going in the wrong direction.

robcorddry,"Leta looked at the hot fudge sundae we had at lunch, pointed to the vanilla ice cream and said, ""Can you get rid of that white stuff?"""

robcorddry,Chuck is now growling at the fireplace. Definitely code for: TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY.
robcorddry,"GEORGE!: ""STOP LICKING ME, COCO!"" That is all he's said since he walked in the door seven hours ago."

robcorddry,Manuscript finished. That bottle of bourbon in our liquor cabinet should be very afraid.
robcorddry,Coco is now barking at the snow as it falls off the trees. I'm wondering if there is a clause in her warranty about this.
robcorddry,How many things can you think of doing other than writing the manuscript that is due in two days? THOUSANDS. THOUSANDS.
robcorddry,My immediate family is taking six separate cars to dinner. Because seven would have been too excessive.
robcorddry,It's snowing. And am I going to complain about it? No. Not at all. I would never do that. BUT I MIGHT STOMP MY FEET.
robcorddry,Coco is barking at the rain.
robcorddry,"Guy in car with SEXYBOY license plate just pulled into the drive-thru at Arby's. Utah, sometimes I want to kiss you on the mouth."
robcorddry,"Both dogs and Jon asleep on the couch, Leta running around the living room without any pants on. Would rather be nowhere else."
robcorddry,Leta looks like she grew four inches taller.
robcorddry,Exit row! Exit row! I feel like I just won a round of bingo.
robcorddry,"Early, early morning. Headed home. Goodbye, Austin! You are awesome."
robcorddry,Major hamburger hangover.

robcorddry,Just saw an original of John Snow's Broad Street map at the Field Museum in Chicago. Second time I've seen it live.
robcorddry,Someone should invent a Lego vacuum cleaner. Just picked up maybe six thousand pieces by hand. Much easier to vacuum directly into the box.
