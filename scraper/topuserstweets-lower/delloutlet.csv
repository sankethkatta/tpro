DellOutlet,"Me: ""An apron is what you wear when you cook."" Leta: ""Then why do you have one?"""
DellOutlet,Jon must narrate Macworld out loud. This habit of his is right up there with owning footwear made for gnomes.
DellOutlet,"If Twitter replies are any indication, an alarming number of people really do think they're going to see The Curious Case of Benjamin Bratt."

DellOutlet,"Makes me so proud that a crowd that big in Chicago has gathered for something more important than a pro sports game. Awesome, America."
DellOutlet,"Pennsylvania, I'd totally kiss you with tongue."
DellOutlet,Right now Twitter is making me feel like I just went on an Adderall binge.
DellOutlet,Note: it is certainly not too early to start drinking.
DellOutlet,Attn. McCain supporters: I already voted. Send those desperate emails to your granny instead.
DellOutlet,Second attempt at early voting: success!
DellOutlet,"Scratch that, line so long we could not find the end if it."

DellOutlet,"Just walked through security at SLC while wearing an Obama '08 shirt, and they didn't search me! Don't they know we're always carrying weed?"
DellOutlet,It's. Snowing.
DellOutlet,I hope that whoever the next president is can help us overcome this divide: http://tinyurl.com/3hhwyv
DellOutlet,Interesting how some people say that we consider Obama to be a divine savior when all we ever said was that he's reasonable.

DellOutlet,"Leta: ""Daddy, that iPhone game is tricky. Here, let me help you."""
DellOutlet,"I get the really uneasy feeling that there are people out there right now going, ""Wait, is Pakistan right next to Kentucky? Thought so."""
DellOutlet,"Unnerving development: I just chose to watch CNN over an episode of ""Access Hollywood."""
DellOutlet,ZOMG! Leta just demanded that we put her to bed. At 5:42 PM. You go right ahead and twist my arm.
DellOutlet,I think I'd have a hard time negotiating with this one: http://tinyurl.com/4qjtk7
DellOutlet,"Reading Leta a book about cows who like to type. Surprisingly, it's not a book about bloggers."

DellOutlet,"That awful, ear-splitting noise you just heard? That was Coco seeing Jon for the first time in five days."
DellOutlet,"Just did some work at the Humane Society, and it was like a three-hour game of tackle football where the goal is to out-cuddle the opponent."
DellOutlet,Just got stung by a bee in the neck and am slowly starting to resemble a linebacker with small boobs.
DellOutlet,"""Sex on Fire"" is on the radio in the car right now, and yeah, I'm actually humping the dashboard. It's not that bad a lay."
DellOutlet,Trying to convince Jon that in fact we DO need an emergency Etsy fund.
DellOutlet,"Whenever someone calls me ""douche"" in a hatemail, I always want to ask them how on earth they ever came up with something so original."
DellOutlet,"Today was one of those days where if you asked me if I recommend having kids I'd answer, ""What is your threshold for pain?"""
DellOutlet,I probably should have pointed out that for every hateful comment left on my post about politics I'm donating a dollar to Obama. Oopsies!
DellOutlet,Ratio of misspelled words to correctly spelled words in my inbox today: I don't think a number exists this high - to - one.
DellOutlet,Aaaaaaand... it just got weirder.
DellOutlet,"Today could not possibly get any weirder, although those are probably famous last words."
DellOutlet,Leta: I don't want you to brush my hair. Me: Why? Leta: Because it's cold outside. Me: That doesn't make sense. Leta: It doesn't need to.
DellOutlet,Headed to Labor Day lunch with my Republican family. Told Jon I would fucking deck him if he so much as whispered the word Palin.
DellOutlet,"Another day, another airplane. Current mood: permanently jetlagged."
DellOutlet,"Internet, I am not pregnant. Just trying to point out that Mythbusters is basically Jackass with a graduate degree."

DellOutlet,"Tomorrow morning I'm going to be on the local news, and I can't decide whether or not I should wear any pants."
