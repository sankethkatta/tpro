psy_oppa,First day of the year with temperatures in the 70s and people are walking around in bikinis.

psy_oppa,"Hoping I can sneak out of the house quietly enough that Bo doesn't hear me, ROO! unexpectedly and wake Jon up with a seizure. Tippy-toes!"
psy_oppa,"Tomorrow morning I'm going to be on the local news, and I can't decide whether or not I should wear any pants."
psy_oppa,"If you're not delighting in the fact that everything is staged, then you're missing the whole point of reality programming."
psy_oppa,You go right ahead and exercise your demons. But you might want to take it a step further and ask them to cut back on carbs.

psy_oppa,"Made too much of a fuss over Leta's hair because she suddenly stomped into her room, slammed the door and yelled UGH! I NEED SOME SPACE!"
psy_oppa,The ring tone on my iPhone is set to the sound of a dog barking to signal when Jon is calling. Coco does not appreciate this feature.
psy_oppa,Leta: How many do I have to eat? Me: 10. Leta: How about 8? Me: 10. Leta: How about 5? Me: You're going in the wrong direction.

psy_oppa,Coco is now barking at the snow as it falls off the trees. I'm wondering if there is a clause in her warranty about this.
psy_oppa,How many things can you think of doing other than writing the manuscript that is due in two days? THOUSANDS. THOUSANDS.
psy_oppa,My immediate family is taking six separate cars to dinner. Because seven would have been too excessive.

psy_oppa,Coco is barking at the rain.
psy_oppa,"Guy in car with SEXYBOY license plate just pulled into the drive-thru at Arby's. Utah, sometimes I want to kiss you on the mouth."
psy_oppa,"Both dogs and Jon asleep on the couch, Leta running around the living room without any pants on. Would rather be nowhere else."

psy_oppa,Just saw an original of John Snow's Broad Street map at the Field Museum in Chicago. Second time I've seen it live.
