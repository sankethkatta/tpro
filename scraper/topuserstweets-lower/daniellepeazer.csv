DaniellePeazer,"Leta: ""Dad, did you buy our house at Costco?"""
DaniellePeazer,Listening to Destroyer and cleaning out the refrigerator. An ideal Saturday morning.
DaniellePeazer,The only way to teach Leta about diversity in Utah is by taking her to the liquor store.
DaniellePeazer,Either these pants shrunk in the wash or I suddenly grew a butt.
DaniellePeazer,"Leta's latest attempt at an insult: ""I'm not caring about you!"""
DaniellePeazer,First day of the year with temperatures in the 70s and people are walking around in bikinis.
DaniellePeazer,Mormon-owned newspaper coming over to the house. Better hide my collection of Noam Chomsky.

DaniellePeazer,I don't think anyone in Palm Springs has ever heard of sunscreen.
DaniellePeazer,"The 80-yr-old man on the treadmill next to mine was running twice as fast as I was, but I win because I had cuter shoes."
DaniellePeazer,oh damn.
DaniellePeazer,OH MY GOD. Memphis. MEMPHIS!
DaniellePeazer,GO MEMPHIS!
DaniellePeazer,"I had on SPF 70 today, and I still got sun. THERE IS NO SOLUTION."
DaniellePeazer,"You want to see me call the police? Park your car in the sun with the windows rolled up, 80 degrees, your 3-month old puppy in the front ..."
DaniellePeazer,I have never been so thrilled to hear the low hum of a lawn mower.
DaniellePeazer,"Sat 2 rows behind Rick Springfield on our flight, resisted urge to run up and stick my tongue in his eye."

DaniellePeazer,"Jon: There is a huge Chinese population in China. Me: Who would  have guessed! Jon: I mean, San Francisco, oh shut up MISS CRAYOLA CROWN."
DaniellePeazer,I didn't want to but they forced me to say poop on live TV. I can feel Maggie gagging from here.
DaniellePeazer,"Hoping I can sneak out of the house quietly enough that Bo doesn't hear me, ROO! unexpectedly and wake Jon up with a seizure. Tippy-toes!"
DaniellePeazer,"Tomorrow morning I'm going to be on the local news, and I can't decide whether or not I should wear any pants."
DaniellePeazer,"If you're not delighting in the fact that everything is staged, then you're missing the whole point of reality programming."
DaniellePeazer,You go right ahead and exercise your demons. But you might want to take it a step further and ask them to cut back on carbs.
DaniellePeazer,"To answer your question, no, I do not think that a dog who poops in a moving vehicle is a _smart_ animal."

DaniellePeazer,"Made too much of a fuss over Leta's hair because she suddenly stomped into her room, slammed the door and yelled UGH! I NEED SOME SPACE!"
DaniellePeazer,The ring tone on my iPhone is set to the sound of a dog barking to signal when Jon is calling. Coco does not appreciate this feature.
DaniellePeazer,Leta: How many do I have to eat? Me: 10. Leta: How about 8? Me: 10. Leta: How about 5? Me: You're going in the wrong direction.

DaniellePeazer,"GEORGE! has Ace of Base in his iTunes, so I checked his luggage and his balls were sealed inside a Ziploc right there under his panties."
DaniellePeazer,Chuck is now growling at the fireplace. Definitely code for: TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY.
DaniellePeazer,"GEORGE!: ""STOP LICKING ME, COCO!"" That is all he's said since he walked in the door seven hours ago."

DaniellePeazer,Coco is now barking at the snow as it falls off the trees. I'm wondering if there is a clause in her warranty about this.
DaniellePeazer,How many things can you think of doing other than writing the manuscript that is due in two days? THOUSANDS. THOUSANDS.
DaniellePeazer,My immediate family is taking six separate cars to dinner. Because seven would have been too excessive.
DaniellePeazer,It's snowing. And am I going to complain about it? No. Not at all. I would never do that. BUT I MIGHT STOMP MY FEET.
DaniellePeazer,Coco is barking at the rain.
DaniellePeazer,"Guy in car with SEXYBOY license plate just pulled into the drive-thru at Arby's. Utah, sometimes I want to kiss you on the mouth."
DaniellePeazer,"Both dogs and Jon asleep on the couch, Leta running around the living room without any pants on. Would rather be nowhere else."
DaniellePeazer,Leta looks like she grew four inches taller.
DaniellePeazer,Exit row! Exit row! I feel like I just won a round of bingo.
DaniellePeazer,"Early, early morning. Headed home. Goodbye, Austin! You are awesome."
