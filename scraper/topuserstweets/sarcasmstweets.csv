sarcasmstweets,First day of the year with temperatures in the 70s and people are walking around in bikinis.

sarcasmstweets,"Jon: There is a huge Chinese population in China. Me: Who would  have guessed! Jon: I mean, San Francisco, oh shut up MISS CRAYOLA CROWN."
sarcasmstweets,I didn't want to but they forced me to say poop on live TV. I can feel Maggie gagging from here.
sarcasmstweets,"Hoping I can sneak out of the house quietly enough that Bo doesn't hear me, ROO! unexpectedly and wake Jon up with a seizure. Tippy-toes!"
sarcasmstweets,"Tomorrow morning I'm going to be on the local news, and I can't decide whether or not I should wear any pants."
sarcasmstweets,"If you're not delighting in the fact that everything is staged, then you're missing the whole point of reality programming."
sarcasmstweets,You go right ahead and exercise your demons. But you might want to take it a step further and ask them to cut back on carbs.

sarcasmstweets,"Made too much of a fuss over Leta's hair because she suddenly stomped into her room, slammed the door and yelled UGH! I NEED SOME SPACE!"
sarcasmstweets,The ring tone on my iPhone is set to the sound of a dog barking to signal when Jon is calling. Coco does not appreciate this feature.
sarcasmstweets,Leta: How many do I have to eat? Me: 10. Leta: How about 8? Me: 10. Leta: How about 5? Me: You're going in the wrong direction.

sarcasmstweets,Coco is barking at the rain.
sarcasmstweets,"Guy in car with SEXYBOY license plate just pulled into the drive-thru at Arby's. Utah, sometimes I want to kiss you on the mouth."
sarcasmstweets,"Both dogs and Jon asleep on the couch, Leta running around the living room without any pants on. Would rather be nowhere else."
sarcasmstweets,Leta looks like she grew four inches taller.
sarcasmstweets,Exit row! Exit row! I feel like I just won a round of bingo.

sarcasmstweets,Just saw an original of John Snow's Broad Street map at the Field Museum in Chicago. Second time I've seen it live.
