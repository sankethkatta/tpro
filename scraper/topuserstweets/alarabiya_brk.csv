AlArabiya_Brk,"Me: ""An apron is what you wear when you cook."" Leta: ""Then why do you have one?"""
AlArabiya_Brk,Jon must narrate Macworld out loud. This habit of his is right up there with owning footwear made for gnomes.
AlArabiya_Brk,"If Twitter replies are any indication, an alarming number of people really do think they're going to see The Curious Case of Benjamin Bratt."

AlArabiya_Brk,"It was obviously a man who coined the term ""morning"" sickness, she says as she throws up dinner."
AlArabiya_Brk,Every morning for the past three days Leta has eaten four pancakes for breakfast. Then she announces that the baby in her tummy is a girl.

AlArabiya_Brk,It is a crime that salt and vinegar potato chips aren't offered on more breakfast menus.
AlArabiya_Brk,Off to throw up lunch. You have no idea how long I've waited to twitter that.
AlArabiya_Brk,"Haven't twittered in a week only to resume with: hey, Photoshop, kindly bend over and grab your ankles."

AlArabiya_Brk,"Leta, pointing to a picture of Dee Snyder: ""Mama, I think there's something wrong with that girl."""
AlArabiya_Brk,I still can't believe people act so surprised when they realize I'm unhinged. What website have they been reading?

AlArabiya_Brk,"I get the really uneasy feeling that there are people out there right now going, ""Wait, is Pakistan right next to Kentucky? Thought so."""
AlArabiya_Brk,"Unnerving development: I just chose to watch CNN over an episode of ""Access Hollywood."""
AlArabiya_Brk,ZOMG! Leta just demanded that we put her to bed. At 5:42 PM. You go right ahead and twist my arm.
AlArabiya_Brk,I think I'd have a hard time negotiating with this one: http://tinyurl.com/4qjtk7
AlArabiya_Brk,"Reading Leta a book about cows who like to type. Surprisingly, it's not a book about bloggers."
AlArabiya_Brk,"Rain, muddy dog paw prints all over the floor, a sick kid throwing up, computer just crashed. It must be Monday."

AlArabiya_Brk,On the plane flying back to NYC. 11 straight days away --all time record post-kids. Cannot wait to get back.
AlArabiya_Brk,Somehow missed the gmail web app for the iPhone. Much better and faster than the built-in Mail app.
AlArabiya_Brk,Overheard at breakfast at posh London hotel: two banker types in their late fifties talking about doing their pilates.
AlArabiya_Brk,Going through security without having to take your shoes off makes the whole thing seem much less stressful somehow.
AlArabiya_Brk,Powering through my email queue on the iPhone while sitting in a hammock by the sea. Or is that the kind of thing best kept to yourself?
AlArabiya_Brk,"This is Barcelona: narrow, twisted, medieval pedestrian streets -- and then you hit the new harbor and it's like: hello, San Diego!"
AlArabiya_Brk,"Wow, already have 44 followers. How come every single one of them is a dude? That's scary."
AlArabiya_Brk,"Dining in Barcelona. Everyone speaking German, Russian, French but lingua franca with waiters: English. Yes! All your base are belong to us!"
AlArabiya_Brk,Trying my first mobile twittering -- from an outdoor cafe in the Barri Gotic in Barcelona. All downhill from here.
AlArabiya_Brk,"Hello, Twitter. I come in peace for all mankind."
