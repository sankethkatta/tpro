SportsNation,"Just did some work at the Humane Society, and it was like a three-hour game of tackle football where the goal is to out-cuddle the opponent."
SportsNation,Just got stung by a bee in the neck and am slowly starting to resemble a linebacker with small boobs.
SportsNation,"""Sex on Fire"" is on the radio in the car right now, and yeah, I'm actually humping the dashboard. It's not that bad a lay."
SportsNation,Trying to convince Jon that in fact we DO need an emergency Etsy fund.
SportsNation,"Whenever someone calls me ""douche"" in a hatemail, I always want to ask them how on earth they ever came up with something so original."
SportsNation,"Today was one of those days where if you asked me if I recommend having kids I'd answer, ""What is your threshold for pain?"""
