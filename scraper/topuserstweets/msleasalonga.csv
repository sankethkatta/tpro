MsLeaSalonga,"Love this! RT @batchout: @paulfeig I would like to suggest a Twitter Game! It's called ""TV/Movie Formulas"" http://bit.ly/1x01K5 #mediamath"
MsLeaSalonga,"Holy crap, I'm so effin' hungry now after reading about all these sandwiches. Dang, you guys are freakin'  foodies. Let's eat! #wich"
MsLeaSalonga,Favorite sandwich? Mine's extra lean corned beef on rye with mustard and extra pickles on side. Label yours #wich.
MsLeaSalonga,"If you put your hands over your ears and rub them back and forth, it sounds like a big storm in the ocean.  I think I need to go to bed."
MsLeaSalonga,"No, this was not an April Fools joke. I'm running a legit tweet here. :0)  Thanks all of you for playing. And, winners, check your DMs."

MsLeaSalonga,"I agree - RT @mlenner: @paulfeig My question is how come there isn't a single, exhastive list of all breakfast cereals ever created?"
MsLeaSalonga,For all my fellow cerealphiles - RT @LowEndRene: @paulfeig http://tinyurl.com/b4x3mq .  PLEASE Go here!!!!
MsLeaSalonga,"Start bidding, everybody -  RT @suomynona: @paulfeig RE: Pink Panther Flakes - http://tinyurl.com/d85ltz"
MsLeaSalonga,This is awesome! - RT @ki_lo: @paulfeig Do you remember Twin Pines' Milky the Clown? This is almost as creepy: http://is.gd/pQ9A
MsLeaSalonga,"Okay, here's one that no one remembers - Pink Panther Flakes. Their claim to fame was that they turned the milk pink. Anyone?"
MsLeaSalonga,"HA! That's high-larious - RT @mark_hammer: @paulfeig That crazy Japanese clown...? Yeah, I remember him. Scary."
MsLeaSalonga,Anybody else remember Screaming Yellow Zonkers?
MsLeaSalonga,"Great words! If you didn't tag your word with a #word, repost it with the hashmark if you want to share."
MsLeaSalonga,"What's your favorite word in the English language? Mine's ""corn."" I have no idea why."
MsLeaSalonga,Gotta go with this one - RT @_: @paulfeig Hostwillity!
MsLeaSalonga,"Think I'll coin ""Twostility"" (pronounced ""twah-stility"") as the term to describe Twitter hatred. Just wish it looked better written down."
MsLeaSalonga,"Love your world dom plans! You're all evil geniuses. Frankly, I'm scared. But in a Twittery sort of way."
MsLeaSalonga,1) Buy all 1972 Buicks. 2) Somehow make 1972 Buicks the sole basis of world currency. 3) Dominate world. #plan
MsLeaSalonga,Sunday assignment. Your plan for world domination in 140 or less. Label #plan.
MsLeaSalonga,Encountering lots of Twitter hate from non-Twitterers in my travels. What's up with that?
MsLeaSalonga,Love it! RT @BeltOutlet: @paulfeig - here's a non-swear swear suggestion -  CAT HOLE - do with it what you will sir
MsLeaSalonga,"Just exercised for an hour. If your feet are cold, that's just Hell freezing over. Sorry for the inconvenience."
MsLeaSalonga,"RT @WayneGraham:@paulfeig is Meredith Baxter-Birney in this one too? - Yeah, she's in pretty much every movie about my life. She and Screech"
MsLeaSalonga,"Today my Lifetime movie is ""Too Lazy To Get Out Of Bed: The Paul Feig Story."" Not entertaining but sadly true. Okay, okay, I'm getting up."
MsLeaSalonga,"@rainnwilson Rainn, I'd watch your Lifetime movie ANY time. Oy, the drama!"
MsLeaSalonga,"What would your personal Lifetime movie of the week be called? I'm going with ""Three Swirlies By Lunch: The Paul Feig Story."" #lifetime"
MsLeaSalonga,"@SteveParkinson Actually, I like Steve's idea better. Let's label them #PGswearing."
MsLeaSalonga,"Any new non-swear swears should get tagged with a #tswear so we can have a public lexicon. I add ""Oh, crazy glue!"" to the mix."
MsLeaSalonga,"I'd like to introduce ""Oh, can of corn!"" into the non-swearing swearing lexicon."
MsLeaSalonga,"Non-swear curse expression of the day: ""Cheese and crackers!"" Use and enjoy as you offend no one."
MsLeaSalonga,"Holy smokes, I'm running late.  Not an exciting tweet but one filled with embarrassing fact."
MsLeaSalonga,"@nicoleva Dang. It felt unoriginal the minute I typed it. Sorry, everyone."
MsLeaSalonga,"""energetic corpse"" #twords"
MsLeaSalonga,"@SteveParkinson Steve, meant to address that last tweet to you. Sorry I have big thumbs and a small iTouch. Wait, that sounded filthy."
MsLeaSalonga,@csstieber I think this whole exercise is becoming a band naming machine. Can't wait to see the Pleated Douches in concert.
MsLeaSalonga,"New challenge: find two words never used together in the history of speech. Label as #twords. Me first - ""carmelized armchair"""
MsLeaSalonga,Very sad that I just watched the season finale of Flight of the Conchords.  I don't think I can wait until the next season. Love this show!
MsLeaSalonga,"Yesterday we were labeling the Twee-ater pieces as #tplay, not the plural (#tplays). Just so they can be found in one search."
MsLeaSalonga,Your Tweeater plays are fantastic! Thanks to all who have participated. I say we keep these going a second day. They're really fun.
MsLeaSalonga,"Richest man in the world: Oh, crap, I forgot my wallet. (Slow fade to black as his ice cream slowly melts in front of the cashier) #tplays"
MsLeaSalonga,"She: Did you poop your pants? He: No! She: Well, someone did. He: Can we not talk about this? (Long beat) He: ... Define ""poop."" #tplays"
MsLeaSalonga,King Henry the 8th: I want a divorce.  Queen: (sighs; stands) I'll get the axe.  King Henry the 8th: And a Diet Coke while you're up. #tplay
MsLeaSalonga,"He: 2+2=4.
She: Wrong.
He: Um ... 5?
She: Nope.  4.
He: Let's get married.
She: We'll see.
#tplay"
MsLeaSalonga,Sunday fun!  Some Twee-ater.  One Tweet plays.  I'll start.  Let's label them #tplay so we can check each other's work.
MsLeaSalonga,"Love hearing your drinks! You all have great taste. To those who asked, Plymouth is a gin. And a tasty one at that. Cheers and good night!"
MsLeaSalonga,"Drink of choice? Mine's a Plymouth martini up with a twist. Whatever your poison, cheers from me to you!"
MsLeaSalonga,"My weekend is all about food, friends and booze. (Not quite in that order, though.) Anyone else doing the same?"
MsLeaSalonga,"Cripes, I need to lose a few pounds.  If you see me on the street, do not feed me."
MsLeaSalonga,I'm awash in all your great Tweetales.  Thanks for taking part.  It was super fun.  I'll figure a better way to post them when next we play.
MsLeaSalonga,More of your fantastic Tweetales are in my Favorites bin.  Hopefully they're all getting in there.  But I definitely put them all in.
MsLeaSalonga,Now Tweetales from 12 hours ago are appearing but others are disappearing.  Wonder if it just randomly selects favs.  It's screwy.
MsLeaSalonga,Is there a limit to the number of favorites I can save?  I marked everybody's Tweetale but anything older than 5 hours ago didn't post.
MsLeaSalonga,I marked everyone's story so far as a favorite.  So see if you can read them that way.  I think it'll work.
MsLeaSalonga,Everyone's Tweetales rock! How do we get these their own page? The world should see your work.
MsLeaSalonga,"Desperate to fit in, he laughed way too loudly. They told him to settle down. He went home and replayed the scene for the rest of his life."
MsLeaSalonga,"Has anyone ever done Tweetales? Short stories of 140 letters or less? If not, let's do some! Is this a new idea or old? I'm new to Twitter."
MsLeaSalonga,I went with the pancakes this morning. Is that my huge ass in my pants or am I just happy to see you?
MsLeaSalonga,"It's a bit disturbing to realize all my favorite new possessions are useless if there's a power outage. Hello, pen and paper!"
MsLeaSalonga,"Thanks to my wife, I now have the theme to Dancin' with the Stars stuck in my head. Time to jump off the roof."
MsLeaSalonga,Rushed from editing and am now sound mixing next week's episode.   I think it's a good one. But I'm biased.
MsLeaSalonga,"I'm overwhelmed by all my new Twitter pals! But in a good way. Thanks, Rainn! I won't let you down. Or at least I'll try not to."
MsLeaSalonga,Heading in to edit my latest episode of The Office. Sorry for the boring tweet. Better next time. I swear.
MsLeaSalonga,The enemy agents have released me and apologized. But they offered no explanation. Enemy agents are weird.
MsLeaSalonga,@markmazur really? Which book?
MsLeaSalonga,I was just captured by enemy agents.  They left me with only my Blackberry and my wits.  I must think clearly.
MsLeaSalonga,I'm trying to figure out how to use Twitter.  And wondering if I'm supposed to refer to myself in the third person or not.
MsLeaSalonga,Paul has to get up crazy early. Good night!
MsLeaSalonga,"So far, I'm ahead of schedule. Probably just jinxed myself."
MsLeaSalonga,Paul is on the set.
MsLeaSalonga,Trying to get out of bed and get to work.
