g1,"Me: ""An apron is what you wear when you cook."" Leta: ""Then why do you have one?"""
g1,Jon must narrate Macworld out loud. This habit of his is right up there with owning footwear made for gnomes.
g1,"If Twitter replies are any indication, an alarming number of people really do think they're going to see The Curious Case of Benjamin Bratt."

g1,"Makes me so proud that a crowd that big in Chicago has gathered for something more important than a pro sports game. Awesome, America."
g1,"Pennsylvania, I'd totally kiss you with tongue."
g1,Right now Twitter is making me feel like I just went on an Adderall binge.
g1,Note: it is certainly not too early to start drinking.

g1,"Just did some work at the Humane Society, and it was like a three-hour game of tackle football where the goal is to out-cuddle the opponent."
g1,Just got stung by a bee in the neck and am slowly starting to resemble a linebacker with small boobs.
g1,"""Sex on Fire"" is on the radio in the car right now, and yeah, I'm actually humping the dashboard. It's not that bad a lay."
g1,Trying to convince Jon that in fact we DO need an emergency Etsy fund.
g1,"Whenever someone calls me ""douche"" in a hatemail, I always want to ask them how on earth they ever came up with something so original."
g1,"Today was one of those days where if you asked me if I recommend having kids I'd answer, ""What is your threshold for pain?"""
g1,I probably should have pointed out that for every hateful comment left on my post about politics I'm donating a dollar to Obama. Oopsies!
g1,Ratio of misspelled words to correctly spelled words in my inbox today: I don't think a number exists this high - to - one.
g1,Aaaaaaand... it just got weirder.
g1,"Today could not possibly get any weirder, although those are probably famous last words."
g1,Leta: I don't want you to brush my hair. Me: Why? Leta: Because it's cold outside. Me: That doesn't make sense. Leta: It doesn't need to.
