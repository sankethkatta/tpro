TheRock,"Sorry folks for the downtime tonight, we are working to stabilize things"

TheRock,"We are getting hit with higher than normal traffic, site is acting a little slow right now...working to fix this"
TheRock,Fixed a bug that caused images larger than 2mb to be rejected. We accept images up to 5mb in size now
TheRock,"In case you missed it last night, we made a video to say thank you to all our users http://tinyurl.com/6aajld (Retweet if you like it)"
TheRock,Looks like the flood of traffic took down our blog...fixing...
TheRock,This is saying thank you to all the Twitpic users http://tinyurl.com/6aajld
TheRock,"We have a blog! http://blog.twitpic.com Finally, dang...who's not getting paid around here"
TheRock,"In case you missed it, we hit our 1,000,000th photo yesterday, here's the photo: http://twitpic.com/lfls"
TheRock,"Just got off the phone with @phillipparis to let him know he uploaded the 1,000,000th photo and that he won a $300 apple gift card"

TheRock,I'm grabbing a pizza...*sigh of relief*
TheRock,"Some old photos may not be displaying, we are working on this. We are still syncing some of the data from the old servers over to the new"
TheRock,"It would be a great help if everyone could retweet and get the word out that we've made the server move successfully, thanks everyone!"
TheRock,"If you are seeing the ""We've completed our server move"" page then this means the DNS changes haven't updated in your area yet, hang tight"
TheRock,We're bringing mobile posting back online soon. Some mobile uploads may have not made it to our servers during the move
TheRock,"Some of you may still be seeing the ""old"" server, this just means the DNS changes haven't made it to your area yet"
TheRock,"For those of you having issues connecting to twitpic, they have been resolved"
TheRock,We've completed our server move. We are just waiting on the DNS update to propagate across the internet.
TheRock,We're moving servers! We will be back up later depending on how fast the DNS propagates.
TheRock,We're back from our scheduled maintenance. Thanks for your patience! Things are right on track for our data center move this weekend

TheRock,"@Ronno971 the rest of the photos will be corrected when we turn this feature on, right now its off due to this iphone bug"
TheRock,"The iPhone is writing bad EXIF data to the images so we cannot rotate them correctly, They end up upside down. Twitterrific is testing a fix"
TheRock,"UPDATE: We have a fix to auto orient photos, but haven't turned it on due to a bug in the iPhone that affects Twitterrific uploads..."
