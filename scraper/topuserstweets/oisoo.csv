oisoo,"Just did some work at the Humane Society, and it was like a three-hour game of tackle football where the goal is to out-cuddle the opponent."
oisoo,Just got stung by a bee in the neck and am slowly starting to resemble a linebacker with small boobs.
oisoo,"""Sex on Fire"" is on the radio in the car right now, and yeah, I'm actually humping the dashboard. It's not that bad a lay."
oisoo,Trying to convince Jon that in fact we DO need an emergency Etsy fund.
oisoo,"Whenever someone calls me ""douche"" in a hatemail, I always want to ask them how on earth they ever came up with something so original."
oisoo,"Today was one of those days where if you asked me if I recommend having kids I'd answer, ""What is your threshold for pain?"""
oisoo,I probably should have pointed out that for every hateful comment left on my post about politics I'm donating a dollar to Obama. Oopsies!
oisoo,Ratio of misspelled words to correctly spelled words in my inbox today: I don't think a number exists this high - to - one.
oisoo,Aaaaaaand... it just got weirder.
oisoo,"Today could not possibly get any weirder, although those are probably famous last words."
