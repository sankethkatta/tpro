CP3,Just got stung by a bee in the neck and am slowly starting to resemble a linebacker with small boobs.
CP3,"""Sex on Fire"" is on the radio in the car right now, and yeah, I'm actually humping the dashboard. It's not that bad a lay."
CP3,Trying to convince Jon that in fact we DO need an emergency Etsy fund.
CP3,"Whenever someone calls me ""douche"" in a hatemail, I always want to ask them how on earth they ever came up with something so original."
CP3,"Today was one of those days where if you asked me if I recommend having kids I'd answer, ""What is your threshold for pain?"""
