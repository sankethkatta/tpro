TwitterSports,"Me: ""An apron is what you wear when you cook."" Leta: ""Then why do you have one?"""

TwitterSports,"Makes me so proud that a crowd that big in Chicago has gathered for something more important than a pro sports game. Awesome, America."
TwitterSports,"Pennsylvania, I'd totally kiss you with tongue."
TwitterSports,Right now Twitter is making me feel like I just went on an Adderall binge.
TwitterSports,Note: it is certainly not too early to start drinking.

TwitterSports,"Just did some work at the Humane Society, and it was like a three-hour game of tackle football where the goal is to out-cuddle the opponent."
TwitterSports,Just got stung by a bee in the neck and am slowly starting to resemble a linebacker with small boobs.
TwitterSports,"""Sex on Fire"" is on the radio in the car right now, and yeah, I'm actually humping the dashboard. It's not that bad a lay."
TwitterSports,Trying to convince Jon that in fact we DO need an emergency Etsy fund.
TwitterSports,"Whenever someone calls me ""douche"" in a hatemail, I always want to ask them how on earth they ever came up with something so original."
TwitterSports,"Today was one of those days where if you asked me if I recommend having kids I'd answer, ""What is your threshold for pain?"""

TwitterSports,"Long night spent being kicked in the head by my husband's daughter, and then at 4 AM she's all, can we play now?"

TwitterSports,"Hi, Houston. It's been a week, but you're still damn sexy."
TwitterSports,"Turns out your skull requires sunblock, too. I am your resident skin cancer guinea pig."
TwitterSports,"Nine hours behind schedule, but we made it to Destin, FL. WORTH IT."

TwitterSports,"Tomorrow morning I'm going to be on the local news, and I can't decide whether or not I should wear any pants."
