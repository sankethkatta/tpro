mariagadu,"Tomorrow morning I'm going to be on the local news, and I can't decide whether or not I should wear any pants."
mariagadu,"If you're not delighting in the fact that everything is staged, then you're missing the whole point of reality programming."

mariagadu,Coco is barking at the rain.
mariagadu,"Guy in car with SEXYBOY license plate just pulled into the drive-thru at Arby's. Utah, sometimes I want to kiss you on the mouth."
mariagadu,"Both dogs and Jon asleep on the couch, Leta running around the living room without any pants on. Would rather be nowhere else."
