El_Hormiguero,More of your fantastic Tweetales are in my Favorites bin.  Hopefully they're all getting in there.  But I definitely put them all in.
El_Hormiguero,Now Tweetales from 12 hours ago are appearing but others are disappearing.  Wonder if it just randomly selects favs.  It's screwy.
El_Hormiguero,Is there a limit to the number of favorites I can save?  I marked everybody's Tweetale but anything older than 5 hours ago didn't post.
El_Hormiguero,I marked everyone's story so far as a favorite.  So see if you can read them that way.  I think it'll work.
El_Hormiguero,Everyone's Tweetales rock! How do we get these their own page? The world should see your work.
El_Hormiguero,"Desperate to fit in, he laughed way too loudly. They told him to settle down. He went home and replayed the scene for the rest of his life."

El_Hormiguero,Heading in to edit my latest episode of The Office. Sorry for the boring tweet. Better next time. I swear.
El_Hormiguero,The enemy agents have released me and apologized. But they offered no explanation. Enemy agents are weird.
El_Hormiguero,@markmazur really? Which book?
El_Hormiguero,I was just captured by enemy agents.  They left me with only my Blackberry and my wits.  I must think clearly.
El_Hormiguero,I'm trying to figure out how to use Twitter.  And wondering if I'm supposed to refer to myself in the third person or not.
