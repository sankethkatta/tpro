MarthaStewart,Ok blog is back up...once again...We are hiring http://tinyurl.com/6rra3m

MarthaStewart,We are hiring! http://tinyurl.com/6rra3m
MarthaStewart,"Things are running normal again after several server fixes, thanks everyone for being patient with us (please retweet)"
MarthaStewart,"Sorry folks for the downtime tonight, we are working to stabilize things"
MarthaStewart,Squeezing some extra capacity out of our servers...constraints breed creativity
MarthaStewart,"We are getting hit with higher than normal traffic, site is acting a little slow right now...working to fix this"
MarthaStewart,Fixed a bug that caused images larger than 2mb to be rejected. We accept images up to 5mb in size now
MarthaStewart,"In case you missed it last night, we made a video to say thank you to all our users http://tinyurl.com/6aajld (Retweet if you like it)"
MarthaStewart,Looks like the flood of traffic took down our blog...fixing...
MarthaStewart,This is saying thank you to all the Twitpic users http://tinyurl.com/6aajld
MarthaStewart,"We have a blog! http://blog.twitpic.com Finally, dang...who's not getting paid around here"
MarthaStewart,"In case you missed it, we hit our 1,000,000th photo yesterday, here's the photo: http://twitpic.com/lfls"
MarthaStewart,"Just got off the phone with @phillipparis to let him know he uploaded the 1,000,000th photo and that he won a $300 apple gift card"
MarthaStewart,"This is the 1,000,000th photo http://twitpic.com/lfls by @phillipparis"
MarthaStewart,"We hit our 1,000,000th photo today! A huge thank you to everyone who uses Twitpic and helped us get here! It's been a blast"
MarthaStewart,Our data center told us that our rack's power unit had blown. They have replaced it and everything is running normal again.

MarthaStewart,"Our data center is having some connectivity issues, we are working with them now to get this fixed"
MarthaStewart,"We've redone the ""Upload Photo"" page to fix issues with those not able to upload from the site itself. Email us if you still have issues"
MarthaStewart,We are still getting slammed by digg.com
MarthaStewart,Twitpic is running a little slow this morning due to a photo making the front page of http://digg.com today
MarthaStewart,"An issue where some photo updates by phone that were making it to Twitpic, but not to twitter should be fixed now"
MarthaStewart,Twitpic runs a bajillion percent better now and is also good for your health (may cause sudden fits of joy resulting in wetting yourself)
MarthaStewart,All photos have now been moved over to the new servers
MarthaStewart,"@JediWright we post the photos as soon as we receive them from your mobile carrier, no delays since we moved to the new servers"
MarthaStewart,"Some photos uploaded in the past few weeks may not be displaying, this will be fixed by tomorrow as we are syncing the data between servers"
MarthaStewart,"If you were getting an error when accessing our API, this has been fixed"
MarthaStewart,Uploading to Twitpic from Twitterrific or other apps may not work yet until the DNS changes have taken full affect
MarthaStewart,I'm grabbing a pizza...*sigh of relief*
MarthaStewart,"Some old photos may not be displaying, we are working on this. We are still syncing some of the data from the old servers over to the new"
MarthaStewart,"It would be a great help if everyone could retweet and get the word out that we've made the server move successfully, thanks everyone!"
MarthaStewart,"If you are seeing the ""We've completed our server move"" page then this means the DNS changes haven't updated in your area yet, hang tight"
MarthaStewart,We're bringing mobile posting back online soon. Some mobile uploads may have not made it to our servers during the move
MarthaStewart,"Some of you may still be seeing the ""old"" server, this just means the DNS changes haven't made it to your area yet"
MarthaStewart,"For those of you having issues connecting to twitpic, they have been resolved"
MarthaStewart,We've completed our server move. We are just waiting on the DNS update to propagate across the internet.
MarthaStewart,We're moving servers! We will be back up later depending on how fast the DNS propagates.
MarthaStewart,We're back from our scheduled maintenance. Thanks for your patience! Things are right on track for our data center move this weekend
MarthaStewart,"We're back down for some quick maintenance, we will be back up shortly"
MarthaStewart,Photo of the guy behind Twitpic http://twitpic.com/hbu3 (@noaheverett) thanks for the spontaneous Q&A session everyone!
MarthaStewart,Yes twitpic is single
MarthaStewart,"That's just a photo of 2 of the new servers. There are more. Its scattered all over the apartment, bachelor pad only has so much room"
MarthaStewart,Photo of some of the new servers in my(@noaheverett) apartment http://twitpic.com/hbmy as requested =)
MarthaStewart,The new servers will fix the issue with random dropped photo updates to twitter
MarthaStewart,My apartment looks like a mini data center. Set to go live this weekend with the new servers. Thanks everyone for being patient with us!
MarthaStewart,We're on track for our new servers going live next weekend. Thank you again for all your patience while we grow.
MarthaStewart,Thank you for your patience everyone while we work to scale twitpic to keep up with the traffic demands. You guys are the best.

MarthaStewart,"@Ronno971 the rest of the photos will be corrected when we turn this feature on, right now its off due to this iphone bug"
MarthaStewart,"The iPhone is writing bad EXIF data to the images so we cannot rotate them correctly, They end up upside down. Twitterrific is testing a fix"
MarthaStewart,"UPDATE: We have a fix to auto orient photos, but haven't turned it on due to a bug in the iPhone that affects Twitterrific uploads..."
MarthaStewart,We're working on fixing the orientation of pictures that come in oriented sideways or upside down. We're testing the fix now.
