RobertsEmma,"Me: ""An apron is what you wear when you cook."" Leta: ""Then why do you have one?"""

RobertsEmma,"Makes me so proud that a crowd that big in Chicago has gathered for something more important than a pro sports game. Awesome, America."
RobertsEmma,"Pennsylvania, I'd totally kiss you with tongue."
RobertsEmma,Right now Twitter is making me feel like I just went on an Adderall binge.
RobertsEmma,Note: it is certainly not too early to start drinking.
RobertsEmma,Attn. McCain supporters: I already voted. Send those desperate emails to your granny instead.
RobertsEmma,Second attempt at early voting: success!

RobertsEmma,It's. Snowing.
RobertsEmma,I hope that whoever the next president is can help us overcome this divide: http://tinyurl.com/3hhwyv

RobertsEmma,"Just did some work at the Humane Society, and it was like a three-hour game of tackle football where the goal is to out-cuddle the opponent."
RobertsEmma,Just got stung by a bee in the neck and am slowly starting to resemble a linebacker with small boobs.
RobertsEmma,"""Sex on Fire"" is on the radio in the car right now, and yeah, I'm actually humping the dashboard. It's not that bad a lay."
RobertsEmma,Trying to convince Jon that in fact we DO need an emergency Etsy fund.
RobertsEmma,"Whenever someone calls me ""douche"" in a hatemail, I always want to ask them how on earth they ever came up with something so original."
RobertsEmma,"Today was one of those days where if you asked me if I recommend having kids I'd answer, ""What is your threshold for pain?"""
RobertsEmma,I probably should have pointed out that for every hateful comment left on my post about politics I'm donating a dollar to Obama. Oopsies!
RobertsEmma,Ratio of misspelled words to correctly spelled words in my inbox today: I don't think a number exists this high - to - one.
RobertsEmma,Aaaaaaand... it just got weirder.
RobertsEmma,"Today could not possibly get any weirder, although those are probably famous last words."
RobertsEmma,Leta: I don't want you to brush my hair. Me: Why? Leta: Because it's cold outside. Me: That doesn't make sense. Leta: It doesn't need to.
