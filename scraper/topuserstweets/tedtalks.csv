tedtalks,"@SteveParkinson Actually, I like Steve's idea better. Let's label them #PGswearing."
tedtalks,"Any new non-swear swears should get tagged with a #tswear so we can have a public lexicon. I add ""Oh, crazy glue!"" to the mix."

tedtalks,"New challenge: find two words never used together in the history of speech. Label as #twords. Me first - ""carmelized armchair"""
tedtalks,Very sad that I just watched the season finale of Flight of the Conchords.  I don't think I can wait until the next season. Love this show!
tedtalks,"Yesterday we were labeling the Twee-ater pieces as #tplay, not the plural (#tplays). Just so they can be found in one search."
tedtalks,Your Tweeater plays are fantastic! Thanks to all who have participated. I say we keep these going a second day. They're really fun.
tedtalks,"Richest man in the world: Oh, crap, I forgot my wallet. (Slow fade to black as his ice cream slowly melts in front of the cashier) #tplays"

tedtalks,"My weekend is all about food, friends and booze. (Not quite in that order, though.) Anyone else doing the same?"
tedtalks,"Cripes, I need to lose a few pounds.  If you see me on the street, do not feed me."
tedtalks,I'm awash in all your great Tweetales.  Thanks for taking part.  It was super fun.  I'll figure a better way to post them when next we play.
tedtalks,More of your fantastic Tweetales are in my Favorites bin.  Hopefully they're all getting in there.  But I definitely put them all in.
tedtalks,Now Tweetales from 12 hours ago are appearing but others are disappearing.  Wonder if it just randomly selects favs.  It's screwy.
tedtalks,Is there a limit to the number of favorites I can save?  I marked everybody's Tweetale but anything older than 5 hours ago didn't post.
tedtalks,I marked everyone's story so far as a favorite.  So see if you can read them that way.  I think it'll work.
tedtalks,Everyone's Tweetales rock! How do we get these their own page? The world should see your work.
tedtalks,"Desperate to fit in, he laughed way too loudly. They told him to settle down. He went home and replayed the scene for the rest of his life."
tedtalks,"Has anyone ever done Tweetales? Short stories of 140 letters or less? If not, let's do some! Is this a new idea or old? I'm new to Twitter."
tedtalks,I went with the pancakes this morning. Is that my huge ass in my pants or am I just happy to see you?

tedtalks,Rushed from editing and am now sound mixing next week's episode.   I think it's a good one. But I'm biased.
tedtalks,"I'm overwhelmed by all my new Twitter pals! But in a good way. Thanks, Rainn! I won't let you down. Or at least I'll try not to."
tedtalks,Heading in to edit my latest episode of The Office. Sorry for the boring tweet. Better next time. I swear.
tedtalks,The enemy agents have released me and apologized. But they offered no explanation. Enemy agents are weird.
tedtalks,@markmazur really? Which book?
tedtalks,I was just captured by enemy agents.  They left me with only my Blackberry and my wits.  I must think clearly.
tedtalks,I'm trying to figure out how to use Twitter.  And wondering if I'm supposed to refer to myself in the third person or not.
tedtalks,Paul has to get up crazy early. Good night!
tedtalks,"So far, I'm ahead of schedule. Probably just jinxed myself."
