ValeYellow46,"Up to my eyeballs in dooce.com administrative work. It's not all pajamas and bacon in here, people."
ValeYellow46,"@textism No, you're the Brian Dunkleman who mysteriously disappeared after the first season."
ValeYellow46,Merlin Mann is the Ryan Seacrest of the Internet.

ValeYellow46,"Tomorrow morning I'm going to be on the local news, and I can't decide whether or not I should wear any pants."
ValeYellow46,"If you're not delighting in the fact that everything is staged, then you're missing the whole point of reality programming."
