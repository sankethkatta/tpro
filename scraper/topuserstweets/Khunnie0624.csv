Khunnie0624,"Another day, another airplane. Current mood: permanently jetlagged."
Khunnie0624,"Internet, I am not pregnant. Just trying to point out that Mythbusters is basically Jackass with a graduate degree."

Khunnie0624,Me and Jon: trying to save water by not flushing at night. Leta in the morning: COULD YOU PLEASE FLUSH THE TOILET! GOSH!
Khunnie0624,"Cause and effect: bought tv at Costco on AmEx, they offer platinum card, now sipping bloody mary in Crown Room at SFO. Thanks, flat screen."

Khunnie0624,"Just ran into Rosanna Arquette at the port-a-potties, could only manage, ""That one's clogged."""

Khunnie0624,"Leta: ""Mom, when I was your age I was able to read that book all by myself."""

Khunnie0624,Coco is now eating rocks. And I am letting her.

Khunnie0624,OMG Leta is eating pancakes for the first time. NO ONE BREATHE.
Khunnie0624,Just saw a guy on a scooter leaving the grocery store with two heaping bags of groceries in his lap. Really hoping he bought eggs.
Khunnie0624,"Got a txt message that ended with, ""From your good friend."" Oddly the txt didn't ask me if I had ever heard about these phones without wires"

Khunnie0624,"Power is out, and the light from the iPhone is making Jon squint in pain."
Khunnie0624,"Ask yourself: if you act on the urge to send someone a hateful tweet, don't you think it's time to extract that three-week old tampon?"
Khunnie0624,"Up to my eyeballs in dooce.com administrative work. It's not all pajamas and bacon in here, people."
Khunnie0624,"@textism No, you're the Brian Dunkleman who mysteriously disappeared after the first season."
Khunnie0624,Merlin Mann is the Ryan Seacrest of the Internet.

Khunnie0624,"Leta: Girls are good, boys are bad. Me: Leta, that's called wisdom."
Khunnie0624,Almost broke my back.
Khunnie0624,"Me: Leta, you need to go potty before we go. Leta: But I already went potty yesterday!"
Khunnie0624,Demolishing the garage. Jon has Movable Type hair.
Khunnie0624,We turn our back for a minute and Coco eats an entire bag of Ricola Lemon Mint cough drops. Jon's on poop duty for the rest of the week.
Khunnie0624,The urge to grab a handful of chocolate Teddy Grahams is almost unbearable.
Khunnie0624,Moment of weakness. Want nothing more than a plate of sushi right now.
Khunnie0624,"Burst of energy just hit me like a train carrying 10 tons of espresso, and it's only day 4. I'm thinking this cleanse was a good idea."
Khunnie0624,WORST HEADACHE OF MY LIFE.
Khunnie0624,"Hi, Houston. It's been a week, but you're still damn sexy."
Khunnie0624,"Turns out your skull requires sunblock, too. I am your resident skin cancer guinea pig."
Khunnie0624,"Nine hours behind schedule, but we made it to Destin, FL. WORTH IT."
Khunnie0624,Forgotten how adorable it is that people in Alabama love to strap furniture to the top of their car.
Khunnie0624,"Stuck in Houston, being re- routed through Mobile. Hello, Alabama!"
Khunnie0624,"Gulf of Mexico, here we come!"
Khunnie0624,"I put a dress on Leta, she primps for a second and says, ""My kids at school are going to LOVE this."""
Khunnie0624,Probably not a good idea to be driving a car if your face is attached to an oxygen tank sitting on the passenger seat.
Khunnie0624,How to annoy me: describe any object in my house as possessing pizzazz.
Khunnie0624,This morning was the first time I have heard thunder in three years.
Khunnie0624,I slept through the night!
Khunnie0624,The airline industry is broken.
Khunnie0624,Forced Jon to listen to old George Michael album because I knew it would heal his soul. It got me laid.

Khunnie0624,"Leta: ""I threw up at school tomorrow."""
Khunnie0624,Taking it as a compliment that I can totally hear the high-pitched noise certain establishments blast to keep away obnoxious teens.
Khunnie0624,Spending the day cleaning the floors. I call it meditation.
Khunnie0624,Panic attack.
Khunnie0624,"Me and Leta, dancing in the kitchen to Elton John after a very long day. Hold me closer, Tony Danza."
Khunnie0624,"Beginning your email with, ""Hello, Heather and Ron,"" is not doing a good job of convincing me to write about your product."
Khunnie0624,"I'm thinking a whole bunch of cyclists got together and were all, these outfits just aren't there yet. How can we make them more ridiculous?"
Khunnie0624,"Leta: I want the pink cookies with the smarkles on top. Me: You mean sprinkles? Leta: Yes, smarkles."
Khunnie0624,Up early this morning to participate in Race for the Cure. Will be carrying tissue for more than one reason.
Khunnie0624,"My cell phone rings, and Leta turns to me and says, ""AARGH! Your phone is singing at me."""
Khunnie0624,Indulging in a two-scoop Oreo cheesecake ice cream cone.
Khunnie0624,"Brooklyn gave me a wicked sinus infection, and still I want to cuddle with it a few more minutes in bed. Last night was so awesome."

Khunnie0624,Feeling the summer 2006 sickness in my gut.
Khunnie0624,Breaking the sabbath.
Khunnie0624,Just saw a man changing his kid's poopy diaper on the hood of his car. Only in Utah. And maybe Alabama.

Khunnie0624,Playing princess games on Mama's computer. It is as thrilling as it sounds.

Khunnie0624,READY TO KILL MY PUBLISHER. SLOWLY. PREFERABLY WITH MY BARE HANDS.
Khunnie0624,P.S. Jon was once a Mormon missionary. Awwwww yeahhhh.

Khunnie0624,Me: Knock knock. Leta: Who's there? Me: Banana. Leta: THAT IS SO FUNNY!
Khunnie0624,Turns out you can't say balls on network television.
Khunnie0624,This is the twitter wherein I do not mention that it is snowing.

Khunnie0624,"Leta's latest attempt at an insult: ""I'm not caring about you!"""
Khunnie0624,First day of the year with temperatures in the 70s and people are walking around in bikinis.

Khunnie0624,I have never been so thrilled to hear the low hum of a lawn mower.
Khunnie0624,"Sat 2 rows behind Rick Springfield on our flight, resisted urge to run up and stick my tongue in his eye."
Khunnie0624,Headed to Palm Springs. Forecast says mid-80s all week. May not be using the return ticket.
Khunnie0624,"Jon: There is a huge Chinese population in China. Me: Who would  have guessed! Jon: I mean, San Francisco, oh shut up MISS CRAYOLA CROWN."
Khunnie0624,I didn't want to but they forced me to say poop on live TV. I can feel Maggie gagging from here.
Khunnie0624,"Hoping I can sneak out of the house quietly enough that Bo doesn't hear me, ROO! unexpectedly and wake Jon up with a seizure. Tippy-toes!"
Khunnie0624,"Tomorrow morning I'm going to be on the local news, and I can't decide whether or not I should wear any pants."
Khunnie0624,"If you're not delighting in the fact that everything is staged, then you're missing the whole point of reality programming."
Khunnie0624,You go right ahead and exercise your demons. But you might want to take it a step further and ask them to cut back on carbs.
Khunnie0624,"To answer your question, no, I do not think that a dog who poops in a moving vehicle is a _smart_ animal."
Khunnie0624,"Leta: ""Mom? When we get to the library can I take my pants off?"""
Khunnie0624,My sister's Beagle Bo is staying with us for the next week. Jon has already started drinking. Motor oil.

Khunnie0624,"Salad past its sell by date, Jon wants to determine if he can still eat it, walks up to me and says, ""I need you to smell something for me."""
Khunnie0624,"Made too much of a fuss over Leta's hair because she suddenly stomped into her room, slammed the door and yelled UGH! I NEED SOME SPACE!"
Khunnie0624,The ring tone on my iPhone is set to the sound of a dog barking to signal when Jon is calling. Coco does not appreciate this feature.
Khunnie0624,Leta: How many do I have to eat? Me: 10. Leta: How about 8? Me: 10. Leta: How about 5? Me: You're going in the wrong direction.
Khunnie0624,Listening to Kevin Rose being interviewed on NPR. Getting SO WET. In my armpits.
Khunnie0624,Was unable to escape Ikea without buying the LORDUNSTUKKAFINSTRA. That one gets me every time.
Khunnie0624,"""So I said, 'That is so stupid! How OLD are you?'"" Leta from the other room: I'M FOURRRR!"
Khunnie0624,"Jon watched The Hills with me last night, and then we both took a hot shower so that we would feel better about ourselves. Didn't work."

Khunnie0624,Manuscript finished. That bottle of bourbon in our liquor cabinet should be very afraid.

Khunnie0624,How many things can you think of doing other than writing the manuscript that is due in two days? THOUSANDS. THOUSANDS.
Khunnie0624,My immediate family is taking six separate cars to dinner. Because seven would have been too excessive.
Khunnie0624,It's snowing. And am I going to complain about it? No. Not at all. I would never do that. BUT I MIGHT STOMP MY FEET.
Khunnie0624,Coco is barking at the rain.
Khunnie0624,"Guy in car with SEXYBOY license plate just pulled into the drive-thru at Arby's. Utah, sometimes I want to kiss you on the mouth."

Khunnie0624,Exit row! Exit row! I feel like I just won a round of bingo.
Khunnie0624,"Early, early morning. Headed home. Goodbye, Austin! You are awesome."
