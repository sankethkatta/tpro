oprah,"@miletatweets no, but still fascinated. First time I heard was interviewing some nuns on my show."
oprah,"@bmartin2011 could I be a nun? Ahhh a little late for that now!  But even so, NOT my calling."
oprah,Watching Brides of Christ #OurAmerica now on OWN. Find it fascinating that nuns consider Jesus their husband. Thanks @lisaling more insight.
oprah,@3LWTV @lisaling @owntv @CrusePhoto I admire their devotion.
oprah,"@nada0971 yep will have @mayawatson arrange, my treat!"
oprah,@CoWayBo also ask@3LWTV about @DeVon_Franklin 's book. The book and his interview will inspire you and answer a lot of your questions.
oprah,@CoWayBo that's what the 20's r about figuring out which path to take. Watch @DeVon_Franklin repeat at 10am est. on #SuperSoulSunday
oprah,@sandyabrams make sure u say hello.
oprah,@nada0971 China.
oprah,@pamelarcone so true. Cause Life is  better when you share it.
oprah,"@LaCoshia31 thank u, I think people forget that in 25 yrs I've interviewed  Convicts to Nobel prize winners. And everyone in between."
oprah,@3LWTV nope. As I often say to @tylerperry ...that's what friends are for..to share your island.

oprah,@Dr_Duchess @kimkardashian I loved that she could not be rattled. She brought her FULL  self to this interview.
oprah,"@KimKardashian ""I would rather have been beaten up in the media, than live a life that was unhappy"". That to me was truthful and powerful."
oprah,@3LWTV @KimKardashian the big aha for me was the fact that so many women STAY in bad relationships knowing it's going nowhere.
oprah,@SheriSalata big shout out to our OWN/HARPO team for editing 8 hrs of tape and crafting the best of this interview into 2 hrs in record time

oprah,@bonostph bono was 1st to say yes. Still trying to track him down for scheduling. His night time gigs keep him busy. :-)
oprah,@sandyabrams no. He regrets never going back and lost touch. Remember he was a teenager...long before Facebook or Google.
oprah,"@MinPamelaCone my favorite movie line ever..""you think of yourself as a colored man...I think of myself as a man"""
