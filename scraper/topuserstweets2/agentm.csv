agentm,@danomak I KNOWWWWWWWWWW
agentm,"@Papa_Gus Have it, haven't played it yet."
agentm,@hawkeyeharrison Worse than NYC in many parts.
agentm,@Papa_Gus hahah that's a tempting offer.
agentm,"@hawkeyeharrison Best city in the world. Still busted by Sandy, though."
agentm,"@Wasgo That's kinda how I have to be, EVERY. SINGLE. SECOND."
agentm,@amazingjr87 @angiecyli @DragonsNThings Thanks!
agentm,"@Wasgo It's not set in stone. My boss, a VP, gets more than I do. My associate editor gets less. My other guys get none."
agentm,RT @MikeBloomberg: Local food trucks are giving away free hot meals at 21 sites beginning today in hard hit areas. Call 311 for location ...

agentm,"Oh wow. Just remembered that October 30 marked 6 years for me at @Marvel. Year 7, #letsgoooo"
agentm,@dale691 6 years and yes
agentm,@Wasgo I just kinda never play all of them.
agentm,@DMcGuinness37 My life is full of spoilers. I will deal if they come my way. :)
agentm,@canrugger That's one of the games stopping me!
agentm,@eamador101 @DMcGuinness37 shhhhhhhhhhh
agentm,@dale691 Nope. They're pretty much a different company.
agentm,@cdkellerson oh totally.
agentm,"@Lepus_Himself Not even a please, eh?"
agentm,"@pkollar Assassin's Creed games, WWE 13 and a few older shooters. Plus Torchlight II on my PC. Any other recs?"

agentm,@damanedmonds I made it quiiiite weird on the podcast.
agentm,@dale691 No. I'm Executive Editorial Director for Marvel's Digital Media Group. I work on our web stuff &amp; related.
agentm,Question: http://t.co/2IVvCMLZ
agentm,"@dale691 Those are called incentive copy variants. For big retailers, etc. I work on all things Marvel."
agentm,@dale691 I can't imagine there are that many variants.
agentm,"@RealDeadpool That was @FangirlingDaily's fault. You can stab me, but know that she says mean things about you and doesn't respect you."
agentm,"@dale691 I get all my comics for free. I need to read everything for my job. And no, I don't use comics as investment. Just not for me."
agentm,@King0fTheGeeks Not bad!
agentm,@King0fTheGeeks @dale691 Executive Editorial Director for Marvel's Digital group. :)
agentm,@dale691 Definitely looking forward to it. No variants for me. I give all my hard copies away after I'm done. #ASM700
agentm,"@King0fTheGeeks haha no, it was quite all right."
agentm,"@dale691 No worries. Just get asked by so many people and I don't get that. For me, Twitter is about interactions and experience."
agentm,"@dale691 I don't know you nor have interacted with you before. Possibly at some point, but not because you ask. That's just weird."
agentm,@dale691 You ask one question and then ask me to follow you?
agentm,Our intern @HorowitzCentral has a massive hickey on the side of his neck. It is a focal plot point in next #ThisWeekinMarvel podcast episode
agentm,@dale691 Because I am Agent M.

agentm,"@MrWorkrate That is FASCINATING, though. What's the best Japanese promotion right now?"
agentm,@MrWorkrate Yesssss. I remember playing that in college on a friend's Saturn and being blown away.
agentm,@MrWorkrate DANG!
agentm,"@MrWorkrate indoctrinated, rather."
agentm,"@MrWorkrate I had Virtual Pro Wrestling 64, Fire Pro Wrestling D and All Japan Pro Wrestling 2 for Dreamcast. Those got me indoctrunated."
agentm,@MrWorkrate I used to follow more Japanese wrestling. So out of the game! Where was Giant Baba?

agentm,@I_AM_The_Anthem @BenJMorse YES
