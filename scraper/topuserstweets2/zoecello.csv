zoecello,"@ZbigniewHoldys yes. I put my iTunes accounting up there for comparison. but I also sell at shows , on Amazon and on Bandcamp"
zoecello,@TVSven yes ;-)
zoecello,"(p.s. for those not accustomed to Google spreadsheets, you access each sheet via tabs at the bottom of the screen)  &gt; http://t.co/LoHQogCH"
zoecello,@ZbigniewHoldys although it varies widely. For one song streamed 1059 times I got $0.84343402
zoecello,@ZbigniewHoldys yes
zoecello,updated my Spotify accounting data on Google docs with a few notes: http://t.co/EtYJyTwF
zoecello,"@AntonyNBruno if I understand your ?, as far as I know, Spotify payouts to other DIYers are the same as mine, but majors are shareholders"
zoecello,@dbalasuriya actually Spotify pays more like 0.0031 cents per play!
zoecello,@alancfrancis @bmf just woke up! #jetlag
zoecello,@AntonyNBruno FYI I do get paid directly by iTunes and Spotify because I am the label
zoecello,No label here RT @AntonyNBruno: Neither iTunes nor Spotify pay artists. Labels do. And labels don't pay all their artists the same %
zoecello,@ZbigniewHoldys Not all art is equal. Just saying that good art should be able to rise to the top. Artificial systems shouldn't stop it.
zoecello,@ZbigniewHoldys perhaps!
zoecello,"Good night. Do what you love folks, and do it with all your might. Sweet dreams....Z"
zoecello,I like the way iTunes gives the same % to every single artist on their service. Spotify should do the same. #meritocracy
zoecello,"The argument to me isn't about fans buying/not buying music, it's about making the distribution platforms egalitarian."
zoecello,"What needs to change: Because they are shareholders, major labels make more per play on Spotify than indies: http://t.co/9BU8OBlL"
zoecello,@BobbShen ;-)
zoecello,@ChelistaAmargao hola fellow cello
zoecello,@HilbertDavid quite a bit of it. Grass roots enthusiasm certainly can propel a film I think.
zoecello,"I care about honesty &amp; transparency, and I find it weird that hard facts about streaming $$ are hard to come by. Hence, my data post."
zoecello,I'm still an idealist &amp; I believe that money eventually comes to those who work hard. Call me crazy.
zoecello,I know I fed the beast by posting my Spotify data but the whole subject is boring. Just get ON with it. Make music! Money is not the point!!

zoecello,"@blackadders well, I stand corrected then! thank you for that. hope you enjoyed the show and sorry it was so darn hot and crowded!"
zoecello,@MisterManny so in that regard I guess Spotify is certainly better than ASCAP ;-)
zoecello,"I've never gotten royalties from plays on American radio RT @MisterManny: are payouts from radio station plays any better, though?"

zoecello,@zanshin i don't have time alas: i.e. day 1 fly &gt; day 2 radio concerts &gt; day 3 concerts &gt; day 4 fly + radio concerts &gt; day 5 radio &gt; etc
zoecello,"@fredlet shoes though, that's another matter."
zoecello,"@fredlet clothes are replaceable and if not, there is nudity ;-)"
zoecello,@GregPemberton i wonder if you can courier things on the same day: day 1 concert &gt; day 2 flight + concert &gt; day 3 flight + concert &gt; repeat
zoecello,@GregPemberton know any companies that do it? and can do it the same day as the flight (since i have radio and tv shortly after landing)?
zoecello,@petergregson heh heh! i wanted to start using everything they were working on in Tod's medialab studio! or at least hire them for a month
zoecello,@BlakeD13 this photo does a pretty good job&gt; http://t.co/k0vLNRpW
zoecello,@greppy getting it there shouldn't be hard....it's the inner-oz flights melbourne &gt; sydney &gt; adelaide
zoecello,"@petergregson there's also the issue for now that i can't carryon a cello &amp; a toddler, as I was trying to explain to @americanair..."
zoecello,"@petergregson those DI boxes are lovely, but they are HEAVY. i try to pretend my carry on is light as a feather when i get on the plane"
zoecello,@petergregson ha ha! do you use a foot controller at all? i'm also pretty wedded to my motu ultralite and radial DI boxes.
zoecello,"@petergregson but someone always has a cello, somewhere!"
zoecello,@petergregson once my bag was delayed and i had my pedal &amp; interface in it. couldn't find any kind of replacement &amp; couldn't do the show!
zoecello,"It's not hard to find a cello in a hurry, but without my pedal, the looping rig and the microphones, I can't perform."
zoecello,I check the cello &amp; carry the gear. It would be awful if something happened to the cello but it's easier to replace in a pinch than my gear!
zoecello,Trying to reconfigure my gear into a smaller carry-on for Australian flights. This is a puzzle.
zoecello,@vampandora i had some amazing food in ecuador last week. who knew potatoes could be so heavenly?
zoecello,@vampandora yes we do!
zoecello,RT @vampandora: @zoecello With the other kind of door we had a little bastard break in and drain a 5 gal keg of homebrew. That was war.
zoecello,@vampandora no way!! a raccoon frat party
zoecello,@vampandora I think you're right....we're going to have to rebuild the wall and put that other model in!
zoecello,There is a little plastic latch on this model of chip-activated cat door. Raccoons just work at it until the latch breaks and then....party!
zoecello,@iain_chalmers I can tweet the warehouse show info the week before.
zoecello,"@iain_chalmers ok, here's the scoop...."
zoecello,Woken repeatedly during the night by repeated raccoon break-in attempts. They have destroyed a THIRD chip-activated cat door. Hooligans.
zoecello,@Manda_1521 lol!
zoecello,I can totally see you on the other side of the deck door Mr Raccoon. I know you're casing the joint.
zoecello,@iain_chalmers I'm not allowed to say but you could be right. I will find out and DM you
zoecello,Other questions I have today: will the raccoons ever tire of breaking into my house?
zoecello,Question of the day: Do funny people ever get tired of being funny?
zoecello,@alancfrancis for a few days at least....we go to Oz this weekend
zoecello,"A Take Away Show of me playing at the airport, a while ago, on @blogotheque: http://t.co/KdBNZCJ7"

zoecello,@whereishawkins Quito was great. I had some amazing meals.
zoecello,@whereishawkins yup! At the widmer brewery right now! Not a bad city to be stuck in!
zoecello,"Bumped from our SF flight but glad to stay in Portland for an evening, even though we have no luggage."
zoecello,Later alligators!
zoecello,@TeatroSucre what was the name of that amazing restaurant we went to after the concert? Or maybe that was part of the dream too...
zoecello,"Yup, wine wins!! RT @whereishawkins: @zoecello wine. always wine."
zoecello,"Just heard Houston airport PA announcement: ""please be aware that certain comments or jokes may lead to your arrest."" Oops."
zoecello,Er...I don't mean that I was asleep DURING the concert :-)
zoecello,I can't figure out if I should have wine or coffee as I wait for my next flight.  I haven't slept since the concert.
zoecello,Oh I'm so savoring all the extra oxygen here at sea level! It's delicious!!
zoecello,@jpgoldberg I just made that mistake too! I'm clearly doing it all wrong today.
zoecello,#cellotoddler awaits me in Portland. Can't wait to see him!!!!!
zoecello,Sigh.
zoecello,Been in the US 15 min and already 2 people have yelled at me: for texting in the immigration line &amp; having 1/2 inch of water in a bottle.
zoecello,"Unless I dreamt it, 12hrs ago I was at the @TeatroSucre in Quito.  Yet now I'm in the Houston airport. Did I dream all that??"
zoecello,There is very large lady with a cello on her back on the @TeatroSucre http://t.co/6wrXodlG
zoecello,I had an incredible and epic evening playing for a live audience on Diego Sanchez's show at Radio Vision in Quito.
zoecello,"@whereishawkins I'm sorry too, and so will they be...."
zoecello,"just verified the info with them, so cellists of the world, now you know: don't fly American Air to the UK if you check your cello"
zoecello,"FYI 56x24x16 inch cello case to the UK: BritishAir = free; Air Canada, Lufthansa, United = $100-$150. American Airlines = not allowed"
zoecello,"Great dinner, great company. Thanks @TeatroSucre !"
zoecello,Floored by Quito.

zoecello,"@whereishawkins a ha! tonight is my only non-performing night, so i should do something!"
zoecello,@whereishawkins beautiful city.
zoecello,"@whereishawkins good! had some extreme dizzyness, and tingly swollen hands earlier this morning. but coca tea &amp; lots of water helps"
zoecello,"Just realized the sun is will set soon because, duh, I'm near the equator! Sunset in 30 mins at 6:15. Quite a contrast to Seattle last week"
zoecello,"they are little tubes, right?"
zoecello,"#NewWorldArtFunding: all the way from Quito, via the internet tubes, I just funded @HUMANWINE's alternatopian album  http://t.co/CQwMAYOz"

zoecello,@JadAbumrad I'm on my way to Quito &amp; realize the meager history I know is from the @Radiolab War of the Worlds show. Remedying on Wikipedia
zoecello,@autojim thank you! It was an exciting landing nonetheless.  I'm hoping for a less exciting takeoff!
zoecello,@richardegil I will! I played at the house of blues last year...any venues you really like?
zoecello,45 minutes in Houston and then on to QUITO! Whoop! @TeatroSucre
zoecello,"RT @SydneyTimeOut: She's described as a one-woman orchestra, and she's coming our way next month: meet Zo Keating @zoecello http://t.co ..."
zoecello,"Another great PDX airport experience: nice check in, gentle n cheery TSA cello-inspection, breakfast, free wifi, ambiance.  Thank you!"
zoecello,@americanair I'm writing a blog on travel w/ the cello &amp; your 80 inch size restrictions to the UK. Can you tell us the reason for the rule?
zoecello,on my way to Quito in a few hours....
zoecello,@alancfrancis we have our tickets! looking forward to getting there....
zoecello,"Cellists take note: I purchased my tickets to the UK on @BritishAirways instead, since @americanair won't let me check a cello in the hold"
zoecello,"@jamezpolley yes, i know i was asking why they won't just let me pay oversize like other airlines...instead of banning the cello altogether"
zoecello,"@MParson89 wow, even in a flight case?"
zoecello,Clearly the cello-lobby is not as strong as the golf-lobby. #airlines #baggage
zoecello,"My issue is, a 96 inch bag (i.e. a cello) is oversize, so I should pay extra, but to not allow it to be checked? That is the weird part."
zoecello,"yes, the cello flight case is 56 x 24 x 16 = 96 inches. But I can just pay oversize for it on every other airline, why not @americanair?"
zoecello,@AmericanAir that doesn't really help. I travel with a toddler. Have you ever tried to carry a cello and a toddler onboard a plane?
zoecello,"from @americanair website: ""Baggage measuring more than 80 in will not be accepted as checked baggage"". Cello case is 56 x 24 x 16 inches"
zoecello,@americanair @colettecello Taking the cello on board would better but I already get an xtra seat for #cellotoddler. Hard to carry both!
zoecello,@AmericanAir thanks for looking into it. where does the requirement come from? How come I can check the cello on other airlines to the UK?
zoecello,"RT @AmericanAir: @zoecello Zoe, heres the scoop on cellos. As checked baggage, max dimensions are 100 linear inches. Exception is UK. T ..."
zoecello,@MParson89 I've got the BAM flight cover
zoecello,"@petergregson probably a much smarter idea, I would do that if I didn't have #cellotoddler on board too"
zoecello,"Thanks for the reply @AmericanAir! The cello flight case I have is 56 x 24 x 16 inches, here it is &gt; http://t.co/gYwEPpMQ"
zoecello,"@armyoftoys the agent said it was just for the UK...I don't get why. Oh well, different airline!"
zoecello,Glad I checked the @americanair fine print before purchasing my tickets to get to @scotruby. I guess cellists don't fly AA to the UK?
zoecello,An @americanair agent just told me I can't check my cello on to the UK because the flight case is too large. Guess I won't fly AA.
zoecello,"Happy 2nd birthday former-#cellobaby-now-#cellotoddler! Lotsa luv, #cellomama"
zoecello,"@dwaq you're very welcome, glad to help and thanks for listening"
zoecello,@Diana_Amores yes I will!

zoecello,"@whereishawkins I remember spending all my time in Vail very sick. That's the highest I've been I think and it's only 8,200"
zoecello,It's a quick trip: have 48hrs to acclimatize before the concert and then I fly home the following day.
zoecello,"@melaspagaras no, just in and out of Quito rather quickly!"
zoecello,"I'm a bit worried about altitude sickness. Highest I've ever stayed is 8,500 feet and I was weak and nauseous Quito is 10,000 feet."

zoecello,"@whereishawkins well, not true. once a month i watch something: Doc Martin, Sherlock, or old Monty Python"
zoecello,@whereishawkins nothing
zoecello,Have I ever owned a TV? No. I didn't start watching any shows until they became available on iTunes/Hulu/Netflix. HBO is out of touch.

zoecello,@whereishawkins I never fly United on longhaul if I can help it. British/Air Canada/Air France/Qantas...almost anything else
zoecello,"@whereishawkins I have a lot of United miles, but higher status does not trickle down to #cellotodder anyway. United is just cheaper ;-)"
zoecello,"@kevinmarks yeah, I didn't care as much until #cellotoddler. Now all those little details are critical, for us and suffering passengers."
zoecello,@kevinmarks I liked the idea of the 'dreamliner' and it would be nice to have more choice for long-haul....but i'm not holding my breath

zoecello,@indabamusic All You Need is Fluff?
zoecello,@cdbaby so its great that you're offering this service....but artists should be able to say no to things that they object to.
zoecello,@cdbaby my point is: the right licensing is awesome. the wrong licensing is damaging.
zoecello,"@cdbaby Well, that IS my advice for all artists: don't blanket license music! Neither of your sync options allow artist to say no."
zoecello,@AndreiPopa the cdbaby program is all or nothing.
zoecello,"@AndreiPopa there is nothing wrong with licensing, I do it all the time! but sometimes i need to say no (to oil companies, snack food, etc)"
