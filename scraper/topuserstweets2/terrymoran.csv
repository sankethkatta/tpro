terrymoran,"Saying,""I don't want to run auto companies, banks,"" Obama shows just how much power he is concentrating in the presidency, as Bush did."
terrymoran,"BET, Telemundo, the Detroit News--and a blogger still to come, I'll bet. Why did Bush never do this? It's smart,reaches different audiences."
terrymoran,"@TweeterSnap Totally agree. Sometimes a silly question just strikes a chord with someone, or throws them (productively) off-balance."
terrymoran,"You know what? You can tell how good, how confident, Obama is feeling at this point, because of how much he is revealing. He's at ease."
terrymoran,"A flash of wit at first, but this is a serious man.He could've taken this (silly) question and made a gag.But he's giving it thought, heart."
terrymoran,"On abortion,Obama sounds empathetic to the concerns of those who disagree with his position. But his policies are very clear.They lose--big."
terrymoran,"@picklesthedog That's his strength. A very calm demeanor, no matter the issue. Americans seem to like that--right now."
terrymoran,"I used to cover Arlen Specter when the Senate Judiciary Committee was my beat. He's a prickly character, no doubt. Needs a lot of stroking."
terrymoran,"Think of what this guy is dealing with, based on tonight: Pandemic flu, torture, Pakistan's nukes, Iraq. And, oh yeah, the economy tanked."
terrymoran,"Obama might have made a mistake saying the US knows it can secure Pakistan's nuclear arsenal. To Pakistanis, that might sound condescending."
terrymoran,"Whoah: ""I'm confident we can make sure Pakistan's nuclear arsenal is secure.""Sounds like plans, plants, spies, and special ops in the works."
terrymoran,"Don't forget: Join me and @Nightline after President Obama's press conference for a ""Twittercast"" on abcnews.com and ABC News Now."
terrymoran,@robertiles One does get the sense that Obama is less dependent on pre-packaged talking points than many other politicians.
terrymoran,"Tapper--great question. If POTUS says waterboarding is torture, isn't he then obliged to pursue legal action against Americans who did it?"
terrymoran,"@PattyEdwards This is probably wise. The real defense against pandemic flu is good health and hygiene practices at home, work, school, etc"
terrymoran,When was the last time the Detroit News got a question at a prime-time press conference? How well is Obama handling auto industry crisis?
terrymoran,"If the H1N1 flu goes pandemic and is virulent, how confident are you in Obama's leadership of the federal government's response?"
terrymoran,"First question: Flu. A president never knows what will define his term. If a lethal pandemic occurs, pressure to close border will be huge."
terrymoran,Obama's press conference. I never think this is his best venue. But it's a moment for him to seize. Polls show he's riding high.
