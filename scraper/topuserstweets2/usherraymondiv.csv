usherraymondiv,@KaseyMarcelle...Never thought to erase it! Just to ask the question and share the facts.
usherraymondiv,@ohfancynancy....It's a window and elevator pitch. Enough to discuss. Not enough to say too much. Lol
usherraymondiv,@KseniaKennedy...you should visit the National Civil Right Museum in Memphis in this life and I'm sure you'll understand why I feel this way
usherraymondiv,Next question...Why do I only have 140 character on twitter? I have so much I'd like to say. Lol
usherraymondiv,Know your history. Show your children...they deserve to know what was done for them. Where we are is a product of what was done for us.
usherraymondiv,"@HanasEpiphany...A people without the knowledge of their past history, origin and culture is like a tree without roots. Marcus Garvey"
usherraymondiv,History shows us that if ask the question enough times you'll eventually get an answer. Are you willing to walk away til you get the answer?
usherraymondiv,Focus of the glass half full. Work on filling it up? It starts with the question and when there is not answer. You keep asking. Be heard.
usherraymondiv,@laladyfriend...History can't and shouldn't be erased. History of what has been done allows you to address the issues...Ask the question?
usherraymondiv,"No they probably won't take it down ever, I'm sure that's not on the ""Shit to do priority list"". Ask the question is the point I wanna make"
usherraymondiv,"No they probably won't take it, I'm sure thats not of their shit to do priority list. The point I'd like to get. It is to ask the question?"
usherraymondiv,The POWER my friend's is in feeling entitled. To ask the question starts the conversation.
usherraymondiv,We have the right to question...we are entitled to inquire...no??
usherraymondiv,Somebody tell me why that statue of William Nathan Bedford is standing in Memphis? This is one of a billion issues never to be answered.
usherraymondiv,Let me start with this one thing? WHY...is that statue of William Nathan Bedford standing in Memphis?
usherraymondiv,"When will we stand up and ask the question? They did, in a non-violent manner. It took a lot to see results but it was worth ever bit of it."
usherraymondiv,We have come a long way but we've got a ways to go...Usher
usherraymondiv,"Silently Glorification. As I leave Memphis I see a monument. Standing proud, a statue of William Nathan Bedford. Founder of the KKK. WOW!"
usherraymondiv,"Though we have overcome a great deal of prejudice and racial tension. Know that, it still exist in America. It's just silently and subtle."
usherraymondiv,I plan on taking my children some day...they will understand their history. What those men and women did for us is not to be forgotten.
usherraymondiv,Visiting the museum was eye opening for me. If you have children and are able to visit....please do. It doesn't matter what color you are.
usherraymondiv,"While in Memphis I also visited the National Civil Rights Museum. I stood in the very spot MLK was shot down, brought me to tears. Visit it"
