imogenheap,@TheInception is there a way to receive the output as midi notes? Can't see way to do that.

Lifeline, propeller seeds, entanglement, minds without fear, #heapsong3 (next), + #heapsong4 (Dec) is taking me to China!"

imogenheap,@brandroidattack  nop... same as. So maybe it's not such a bargain? I don't know... I guess it saves you the trouble? x

imogenheap,Afternoon all. Today you're going to see 1st FTH video (the one we did a few weeks back). You may understand why I've filmed another since.
imogenheap,@amandapalmer tasty...was thinking interactive @Vokle #CafeHeap improv/chat session/party in NY - could do with brushing up on my baking too
imogenheap,however...Friday night on Letterman...maybe more people kicking back at watching TV? I'll have to think of something fun for release night!
imogenheap,Realized Letterman's filmed 24th but airing 28th. Not ungrateful or anything but that's slightly anti-climatic. 24th being release day in UK
imogenheap,Thanks for the response :) I'm now erring on hiring in a grand with my monome on lap - a few wine glasses to play on the piano and laptop.
imogenheap,@filthymind what's the picture? I haven't seen it yet
imogenheap,playing First Train Home on the piano. Seriously considering going acoustic for Letterman. What do you think? Piano or gear/laptop/monome?
imogenheap,"@rick_hunt Yup, she hit the nail on the head. So true. It's a beautiful thing the walls that have separated us are well and truly down now."
imogenheap,@kraftwerkorange quite possibly... mmm...
imogenheap,@stephish i know ;) thanks for the RT x
imogenheap,"@stephish oh goodness.. I spelled ""your"" as ""you're"". That's annoying."
imogenheap,@madeleinebloom I was thinking to do a #heaptweetup in Berlin. Any suggestions on an intimate venue with a good sound system?
imogenheap,actually sorry... that's meant to be #cafeheap - that's better.
imogenheap,#heapcafe sometime next week while I'm in Berlin. Where I'm staying has fast internet and a grand piano. Let's do it. I want to chat x
imogenheap,"@BurlyQEinstein @jp1113 @elwood - Even with all this twitter transparency, to be read so wrong. It's quite upsetting. x"
imogenheap,Oh @amandapalmer! I so wish we could have dinner tonight. You're words in this post have a hold on me - http://bit.ly/HeapBox - much love x
imogenheap,The video shoot was so much fun! Can't wait to see the rushes tmw. We all sat by the bonfire until 4am. Busy promo day today went well x
imogenheap,Bed now with happy hair. Up in 5hours. I'm excited about it! My first try at directing. Wish me luck! x  http://yfrog.com/0nhugtiyj
imogenheap,Liking the texture of my hair a lot right now. Moving hair pins about for 'the look'. Clothes wise all i know is my blue neck ruff Is in. x
imogenheap,phew! Shoot is all shaped up for tmw. Crew getting here at a very civilized time of 10.30am! Studio now to work on FTH for DL show. xxx
imogenheap,tmw rehearsing for Letterman. All this prep/ travel/ panic/for 3.30mins. It's odd when you think of it like that. night night all x x x
imogenheap,5 hours later.. I think (I hope) I've done the mutli varispeed version of first train home audio I need now for thursday's video shoot. x
imogenheap,@detailfreak  working on in t x
imogenheap,@PalmSounds  woudl love to yes... no time at the moment but yup. Definitely. Have a few ideas already x
imogenheap,Was good fun @ILuvRockStarz. Another fab thing about Twitter is interviewers are so well prepped now we get straight to the good questions.
imogenheap,Was a mad day of interviews today. I'm completely all talked n'posed out. Now to in t'studio to make the varisped audio for my FTH video! x
imogenheap,Didn't expect to be doing what we did 1st thing this morning @mattedmondson for @PocketTVshow! I thoroughly enjoyed finding your inner you x
imogenheap,Ahhh... good old boots does sell it! @KathVaughan - so works for tattooes too? hmm... who'd have thought. Ta for tips peeps. Sleep 4 heap x
imogenheap,Apparently Preparation H works for dark circles (a hemorrhoid cream!). We don't have that in UK so I think I'll try this thing called Sleep.
imogenheap,"FTH video was meant to be out ages ago @Synoiz. The one we shot about 2 months ago will be out asap ""my"" one prob not long after x"
imogenheap,@Spyketh oh yes.... more than once. you'll see :) x
imogenheap,@HimOverThere  thing is.. I've already shot one video... but I have this idea I so want to do. Never felt compelled to direct before!
imogenheap,@DerekSheldon  it's completely mad at the moment. Maybe try me again in a week or two? sorry x
imogenheap,@azc  Good point! Clearly... that is gonna work then. Screeeech. Swooop.
imogenheap,A recent add for the to do list : An alternative FTH video idea sprung into my head the other day. My directorial debut is this Thursday!! x
imogenheap,A full day of interviews tomorrow. !st filmed at 9.30am. Apparently hanging your head upside down gets rid of bags under the eyes? Y/N? x
imogenheap,Hello all x Been sniffing out more apps for Monome today with a little helper I found. Only got 3 days to actually rehearse for DL show now.
imogenheap,ok gonna get back to the snake pit of my audio leads. xx
imogenheap,Ha! Come cheer me on! It's free! I'll be good I pwomise! RT @janakyomoon: @imogenheap Link to Letterman Tickets http://bit.ly/HCOoA  xx
imogenheap,yes you're right @MimAbbyMason! Just in case deletes last post from universal memory. I am going to kick butt on Letterman! Gimme that butt!
imogenheap,ooh i didn't know you could buy Letterman tickets @benjamintaylor2! I would love some of you there for moral support!  Anyone? xxx
imogenheap,Setting up gear in the dining room for David Letterman 24th Aug! Hope for no gremlins in the gear that night! I'm playing FTH. Yikes!
imogenheap,Clown suit was for friend's circus themed birthday party. 2 hours drive in flash (rental) Merc SLK. Clown driving. Double takes a plenty!
imogenheap,I highly recommend walking round as a clown one day out of context. It is immensly good fun!
imogenheap,Looking like a right clown in a traffic jam!  http://yfrog.com/0dujggj
imogenheap,Hello all. Had a wonderful night last night with my friend. Lots of continued conversation on yesterdays happiness tweets. Today clearing. x
imogenheap,@JJ_Pollard  yes! that is my plan. indeed ! Make future music... release instantly ... collaborate more... film/ dance/ theatre. xxx
imogenheap,@swampalicious  that's it. Absolutely. I got to do it for #Ellipse too. Meantime - cogs clunk away to finding a better balance x
imogenheap,@fredfx  yup. YOu're right. I did. Began when I re-mortgaged my flat to be able to 6 years ago. Thank you for the reminder. Courage! xxx
imogenheap,@acciodeath  that is so wonderful! thank you x
imogenheap,thank you for all your really lovely tweets. I feel like I've begun to chase more than steer. I want to grab a hold of what's important.
imogenheap,@annayvette  exactly... that is question of the day! Tomorrow... I'm going to throw stuff away/ say no to a few things. See what happens  x
imogenheap,I wanna make it and equally want you to enjoy it but the more people enjoy it the less time I seem to have to make it. What's a girl to do?
imogenheap,During the making of Ellipse and especially now I wonder.. WHY? Why am I doing all this other stuff when I don't want fame or money.
imogenheap,"About 5% of my time goes to actually making music sadly @MaggieL. The rest is promo, technical, planning, running around, schedules..blah"
imogenheap,Good Food and enlightening conversation are up there and thankfully tonight I will most likely be indulging in both of those :) x
imogenheap,looking at my list.. I need to vamp up my social life. Create more. Work less. Travel. Learn. Understand. Own less stuff. Find love.  mmm..
imogenheap,My happy list is pretty darned long actually! It'd be easier to write out what doesn't. Reading your happy tweets is making me feel good :)
imogenheap,what makes you happy? I'm writing a list inspired by the 1st draft of Stafan Sagmeister's film script I got in the post this morning.  xxx
imogenheap,Yup @orangewerkkraft. Instrumental versions are the songs without vocals. Some may think that odd but I prefer to listen to them like that!
imogenheap,@get_unconscious Best get diapers in then!
imogenheap,"I need to get on that @joeyswartz. Will let you know when you can pre- order the ""nice"" physical album from my site x Stay twooned x"
imogenheap,"Yup @mistyaeons The ""expanded edition"" of #Ellipse will have 2 x CDs. One album as is and the other the instrumental versions of same songs."
imogenheap,stopped chopping @jusgoat's enormous courgette grown in her allotment to show you. What a fine beast!   http://yfrog.com/0ba0doj
imogenheap,@B_Ste  that's not the point! I want to go in and buy one. It's a tradition of mine. I want to have a receipt from day of release :) x
imogenheap,yay! @B_Ste. Only 19 days for Ellipse! I'm rather excited myself! I'll be in NY on 24th so will have to wait an extra day to buy mine!
imogenheap,@madebyrobot Probably a week or two. I only really got stuck in to the monome properly for my improv thing... not sure what'll go up yet x
imogenheap,I missed this talk at TEDglobal on day1. Beautiful refreshing insight on Success and Failure from Alain de Botton http://immi.fm/Pvj  xxx
imogenheap,#heaptweetup sessions were so great! Thank you everyone for coming. Have just left sketch. Had a lovely drink with @jusgoat and jennie. X x
imogenheap,Looking forward to tomorrow's #heaptweetup! Here's the info again http://bit.ly/FAY7F. woop! x
imogenheap,I have just created the event 'imogen heap' http://tw.pn/wxc #heaptweetup
imogenheap,Hello @Hairytic It's not a huge venue no so I'd get there a bit before to be sure. Finding out about age restrictions @joshmoss #heaptweetup
imogenheap,#heaptweetup is free... I'll buy you all a drink too :) I want to be there when you first hear #Ellipse! As much for you as me :) x
imogenheap,"Yeoo! #heaptweetup London - This Tuesday, 7pm, room called ""The Glade"" at Sketch - 9 conduit street, W1S 2XG . Exciting! xxx :)"
imogenheap,#Heaptweetup London will be somewhere central after work for most people. Will let you know more tomorrow. Off to snoz land for me zzzz :)
imogenheap,@MimAbbyMason  I would not wish for that job on anyone. I'll deal with it. x
imogenheap,@claywoman  wow. @EddieIzzard is completely brilliant bonkers. love him even more now. x
imogenheap,@energyUK  certainly does. Are the spam free twitter glory days over already? x
imogenheap,"what's with all the ""Hang in there"" ""kitty laughter"", ""lost a bunch of weight..."" ""free gift"" tweets swamping my DMs? Kinda annoying."
imogenheap,Carried away clearing up. Light in less clutter. Rained heavy today. All cosy inside. Thinking Lido tomorrow. London #heaptweetup tuesday :)
imogenheap,@scaulfield am doing one for Sound on Sound on 11th Aug as it happens x
imogenheap,@ParkerMatt  that would be lovely but I'm not going to make it this year. Boo. Got a US promo trip booked. x My mum's from Edinburgh x
imogenheap,@rio_ben  there is one. I'm thinking #heaptweetup London sometime next week. What do you think?
imogenheap,@tec2030 done that. :) x
imogenheap,@rio_ben  possibly. we'll see.
imogenheap,"@TormntdByDemons  I need to watch out for you don't I! Love both your versions of ""the song that never was""."
imogenheap,"A day off! Something got cancelled. Woop. Jog, watch ""in the mood for love"", clear up house mayhem, get on top, find a friend for dinner. x"
imogenheap,@Guibiajo  Hello x I would love to come to Brazil. Spread the word! x
imogenheap,@balexander907 you'll be getting the fancy one x
imogenheap,I'm so glad you like it @zoecello. I remember hearing your music for the first time and falling in love x hope to see you soon x
imogenheap,@Jasonsoll  Hello you x Please do! I would love to see that :) x Great at #TED... you opened my eyes to the world of flourish.
imogenheap,"@jusgoat over filming a long overdue catch up. So much has gone on in the last 2 months! All good. Heaptweetups, ebay scenario, artwork. :)"
imogenheap,"Holey mama of baby cheeses, isn't life sweet sometimes? I feel like I just lept lightyears in grasping it. Today is a song. how to sleep?"
imogenheap,"A reminder for those of you who have joined the heaptweeting story recently. @heapwire is where all the ""work"" news/reviews goes from :) x"
imogenheap,@CoverMeInInk again... never say never!
imogenheap,"@GarionOrb  not yet, no. x"
imogenheap,@ECR5  if you get the nice version from my website yup. Will let you know when that's all set. x
imogenheap,@Mitholas  never say never
imogenheap,@neil_mccormick  ahh good! When's it coming out? And ... it was an Array (instrument makers) mbira rather than an marimba :) x x
imogenheap,@buffsterboy  hope so!
imogenheap,I'm all a flutter and off to play the piano.
imogenheap,@nickwax  no... you can still get it now can't you?
imogenheap,"@PR1ZEFIGHTER  you calling me a gorilla! ;D *beats chest*, *takes nits out of young ones fur*"
imogenheap,@TJTippins  we're working very hard on getting that together. It's taking a little longer than we'd hoped. Hang in there with me xxx
imogenheap,@PR1ZEFIGHTER  you'll have to ask @tomokelly that one. Somewhere in Newfoundland x
imogenheap,@buffsterboy  Trying to sort out internet here at the house. It's so slow you wouldn't believe and looks/ sounds rubbish. Stay twooned x
imogenheap,@mikebsacks  Cover? You mean the live version??
imogenheap,@JoeyArceo  the scoop is.... #Ellipse is out in 27 days... Woop! No new Frou Frou on the horizon though. plenty of time though x
imogenheap,Amazing response from #Canvas video. So glad you like it! Ta for all the RT's. For those that missed it x http://immi.fm/Kgw #imogenheap
imogenheap,Creaking back into press interviews/Q&A's/FTH video/post #TED email catch up (I went off-line to soak up the goodness). xx
imogenheap,@PrincessPeaLeia definitely out 24th aug x
imogenheap,From beyond ventnor (furthest headland) to cows and now to jog back again. Beautiful coastline.  X x  http://yfrog.com/5ieiiioij
imogenheap,@klodsen  ok cool thank you x
imogenheap,http://immi.fm/Icc  YAY! that's exactly what I was going to say!
imogenheap,@Taqee  I don't but I'm working on that. If you figure it out before I get it done (could be a few months) let me know so we can share it x
imogenheap,@brainpicker Hello you x Lovely to meet you t'other day.  How's your #TED crash? x
imogenheap,Dusk ferry crossing to the Isle of White. The #TED feeling dancing inside me. The crescent moon scoops up the promise of change in the air.
imogenheap,"Bubbles? http://www.good.is/bigideas 

So loving #TED and the golden threads that begin here. Sad tomorrow is the last day. xxx"
imogenheap,'ello :) Sorry no #cafeheap tonight. I will do these but just need to figure out when/where. xxx
imogenheap,@BitterDeviant I do thank you x x
imogenheap,"@talicatz hide and seek has a life of it's own. I enjoy hearing interpretations of my songs, my musical taste or not. Sorry it offends! x"
imogenheap,I'm not sure about #heapcafe tomorrow. Will see what I can do about finding a space/piano to do that in here @BitterDeviant. Stay twooned!
imogenheap,"#TED! Inspired! So many wonderful projects, ideas + people to get excited over. Just had a nightcap of piano noodlings in hotel lounge."
imogenheap,Oh #TED! Thank you! I was petrified up there. Bluffed my way to a standing ovation! How? amazing! So looking forward to the rest of TED! Xx
imogenheap,"'Canvas' from #Ellipse & the beautiful video @tomokelly made are all yours (well, for one ickle tweet :) http://immi.fm/6pY #imogenheap"
imogenheap,"Doh! Sorry... I hear ya... Bad link, one sec......."
imogenheap,No no @leonardklaatu... Completely my fault!! They were amazing sound guys. Really patient and helpful with a rather emotional Heap!
imogenheap,"4 hours later in soundcheck I've given in to the 'easy' set. Defeated by my frosty friend, Time. I will conquer #ellipse live but not tmw"
imogenheap,"Going in (dining room) for last day of rehearsals. Who thought a 15 min gig would cause so much panic! Come on HEAP! sort it, OWN it!"
imogenheap,"I got to get to sleep or tomorrow's going to hang me out to dry. *Please brain... get busy and figure it all out for me in the meantime, tx*"
imogenheap,@KaylinSith MUCH simpler too! It just doesn't look as sexy as the monome. I'm going to love monome when I get to grips with it + fun apps.
imogenheap,@jahala  yeah... I've taken that down to bare minimum. It's a pretty light session. I think my tiredness missed that one. ta x
imogenheap,@joeldobbins  honestly half the time I feel like I'm bluffing it and barely keep up with it all!
imogenheap,@travispickren I am actually thinking... I don't this time! There really wasn't enough time to get this together. May have to go acoustic.
imogenheap,"@joegbs  that worked pretty good from what I can remember. I was trying to keep it ""simple"" and have forgotten all SL stuff. On old laptop."
imogenheap,@MobiWan  Apogee Duet.
imogenheap,"@DanielSpracklin  is shit swearing? I say ""bitch"" on the album so you'd probably best not buy it anyway."
imogenheap,@joegbs I was trying to. Have in the past but not for looping. I'd heard good things about looping in Ableton 8... not happening for me.
imogenheap,Shit. Latency is so bad when recording into Ableton's live looper via monome. NOT good. One day to go and I fear a total rethink for TED.
imogenheap,@madebyrobot  My virginal monome session was two days ago. I think I've bitten off more than I can chew to get ready for @TEDtalks!
imogenheap,Sidetracked. Trying out more creative software with Monome. Just 2 days now. I've got to make it work with what I have for @TEDtalks.
imogenheap,@wheatus  first train home. First song of Ellipse... new album  x
imogenheap,This morning I woke up to no then than 4 blue tits pecking at my window. I have NO idea why.  Tasty glass worm? Very odd but lovely :)
imogenheap,@guysieh  FTH was meant to be released worldwide last Tuesday. Irritating. I'm trying not to think about it. Teamheap is on it though. x i x
imogenheap,Playing with Monome/ hang/ piano/ voice/ mbira/ laptop for 1st ever live version #Canvas @TEDtaks. Well that's almost 1 song.. 3 more to go!
imogenheap,@JudsonCollier  yup. I'm cacking it!
imogenheap,@benfo  it is and no... it's not live... but will be up on @TEDtalks website soon after the conference x
imogenheap,@largen  but silly noises and warblings a plenty xx
imogenheap,@largen  I'm going to try and not do too much of the speaking @TEDtalks. Best left to the professionals! I'd freeeeze up completely. x
imogenheap,@desired_waste  nop. I doubt it... but don't quote me on that sorry x
imogenheap,Getting to grips finally with my #monome 256 unit. My brain needs to learn all commands so it's 2nd nature for @TEDtalks in 3 days!. Xx
imogenheap,I know @rakidd. Annoying on iTunes UK FTH page thing. Trying to get them to fix it. Sorry everyone who's had this issues with that. x  i x
imogenheap,Monome 256 http://monome.org/ pages http://immi.fm/p and Abelton8 http://immi.fm/q. They WILL work together. Perhaps not tonight though.
imogenheap,I really don't know @dustandair. Maybe wait until you get the official from me on Amazon #Ellipse sales. Sorry. xx
imogenheap,@marcomarchese  4th week of November possibly
imogenheap,@dashheartdash  maybe yeah... if not this time... next time. Just figuring out what I'm going to take to TED. x
imogenheap,@emlarsen  yes. I did
imogenheap,@Dane5547  and tweeters with circle eyes and line mouth :)
imogenheap,Just made a test with the @Vokle guys... and it seems my broadband speed is too darned slow for #CafeHeap this Sun. Will do it Thursday x
imogenheap,@jessousley  I was at school!
imogenheap,I'm going to go one better and you can have a HQ download of #canvas on Tuesday @JoshLaForet. Hang tight until then x
imogenheap,#Canvas is up http://immi.fm/o! Directed by @tomokelly. You can download HQ version on Tuesday. Hope you love the song/video xxx
imogenheap,anyway... night night all. Thanks to those of you who twooned into #heapstream session. Turned into a lot of fun :) CU Sundays for CafHeap!
imogenheap,Thought before bed. I completely don't get how Amazon have a deluxe 2 disk CD up when I only decided on that tonight?? http://bit.ly/VuvZS
imogenheap,talking about packaging of #Ellipse NONSENSE... have a listen and tell me what do you think (Broadcasting live at http://ustre.am/2Nie)
imogenheap,it's about packaging NONSENSE! my grand plan has been trampled on and I didn't have a back up. Now salvaging... but want to explain
imogenheap,I need your help. So upset about this situation ... i've been backed into a corner. I'm going to talk on Ustream about it in a bit.
imogenheap,@desired_waste  I have precisely 5 minutes to make this decision!
imogenheap,@nick_merritt  I could never do that to a piano no matter how old a ruined it was. Silly i know
imogenheap,"""the fire"" on the album IS just piano and bonfire. So on the instrumental album version...it's what to do? I can only lose one of them"
imogenheap,@Goodie2212  yes me too :) but I think we can squeeze it on there somehow ;) x
imogenheap,you're right... of course you'd rather hear just piano. Erm... ok. I have a plan!
imogenheap,"I can't decide whether to put ""The Fire""  - no bonfire samples and only piano or ""The Fire"" - no piano and only the bonfire on the CD????"
imogenheap,"oh what to do what to do....long story..too long for twitter but I'm doing an instrumental version of #Ellipse for ""Deluxe CD"" now and......"
imogenheap,"@joeyismusic one pure rounded sound, held. Branching off (quite literally) to more detailed parts, eventually come to a still breeze stand."
imogenheap,@Versatis  I really like that! Nice font work too. x
imogenheap,morning tweeters. Out of bed finally (my bed sheets would NOT let me leave. I didn't fight a good fight).. downloading software for TED gig.
imogenheap,"funny thing is, I don't have time to FIND/ Interview a PA! argh! that was quite a response. I'm sure many of you would be amazing too. oh wa"
imogenheap,I need a full time PA. i'm so dog tired trying to do everything. This isn't anywhere near as busy as it's going to get either. long siiiiigh
imogenheap,@awashtell yup. That was me :) my flat's kinds around there.
imogenheap,@awashtell nop. Wasn't me! I was in soho most of yesterday. It was am immiposter!
imogenheap,@northernlad55 I really need to work on my delegation skills! Life is full of things to do and I need to stop trying to do it all myself.
imogenheap,@northernlad55 no unfortunately on this occasion! Treat live and studio very separately. But... Did think about live at the end of Tidal. x
imogenheap,@glennwolf yeah... That was certainly be easier! It feels wrong not to bring the techno in for @tedtalks though. X
imogenheap,@richard_baker cool indeed and terrifying! It's got to be the most amazing 18mins I've ever played. Yikes. No pressure!
imogenheap,@Michal_Boo what's a slug?? Erm... It's like a big fat snail with no shell. What do you call them?
imogenheap,Walking through the forest thinking how to do the songs live for TED conference 22nd July. There are a lot of slugs out cruising today.
imogenheap,@cameronboi cool! Love Austin.
imogenheap,Had a lovely time with @neil_McCormick here at the house of round. He's writing a piece on me for the Telegraph. Good tweeter too :) x
imogenheap,@neil_mccormick so am I! Much drama in Heap land. Trying to desensitize before you get here!
imogenheap,anyway... funny old game this. I'm off to recharge the batteries with Heapsleep. Night night xxx
imogenheap,I had no idea you could @CadetZemm! #firsttrainhome. Don't have an iTunes account? You can buy FTH mp3 on Amazon http://bit.ly/4xWWA7
imogenheap,@ASinForHer You never bought a bad cocktail? I need to go to the bars YOU go to. Anyway..you can totally listen before you buy these days.
imogenheap,@ThreeWayJam Sometimes... but not this time...You'll see.... it's good!
imogenheap,@MTeson  that is actually part of the plan. Not as easy as all that though coz... well won't bore you with it now. Will do tomorrow though!
imogenheap,@barrysaunders now THAT would be good! Have to be careful not to drive though eh?
imogenheap,too true  @TexAxile! I never thought of it like that! I dunno why? STILL... it's the principle! The shops are just CASHING in. GREEED
imogenheap,"RT @TexAxile: When an album costs $12 and takes years of an artists life and a cocktail costs $18 and lasts 10 mins , Music is  a bargain!!!"
imogenheap,@RegNom  why indeed!
imogenheap,nop @jona_thin. You haven't seen the half of it!! Will fill you all in tomorrow. Talk about cutting it fine! FINAL artwork delivery tmw.
imogenheap,High of course @m_aurelius ! Would LOVE it for you if it was low. It is UNBELIEVABLE what prices the shops set. Totally  totally crap
imogenheap,Had a terrible day battling with some news on shocking album retail prices. Trying to salvage situation. Will let you know tmw. It'll be OK
imogenheap,best things come to those who take showers. I just came up with a rather fabulous idea for my next Vokle session. Stay Twooned!
imogenheap,@VariRinoa  i know... it's crap isn't it?
imogenheap,I just wrote a little bit of blurb up about release date of album/ single info next to mp3 of FTH video on youtube http://bit.ly/FT1Oz  xxx
imogenheap,http://bit.ly/FT1Oz
imogenheap,@XjuktmonkeyX  believe it or not... we're STiLL having issues with it! I will chase again. unbelievable! 2 years +! shameful!
imogenheap,@vmars08 yup x
imogenheap,thank you @lazyrecordsuk! Great! I'd heard rustlings of this but completely forgotten about it. On it!  http://bit.ly/nzOHU
imogenheap,@casinclair  i'm quaking in my boots! can't get to work on my set until Thursday. Yikes!
imogenheap,nop @vmars08. The behind-the-scenes video is mislabeled. It's me giving very small insights into each track on the album. Filmed last week.
imogenheap,"That's more like it @TheBeautyIsFake :) There'll be a package with vinyl, an IH pass thing i'm dreaming up, pics, instrumentals etc in Dec."
imogenheap,@TheBeautyIsFake  and... they are only 3 dollars extra (I got Sony down from $6) not double.
imogenheap,I have to say @TheBeautyIsFake I initially thought the same thing about that but was swayed that they had value in their own right.
imogenheap,"yup @joeyismusic. There's going to be a ""making of #Ellipse DVD coming out by the end of the year. @jusgoat is feverishly editing away! :)"
imogenheap,Nop @desired_waste  The instrumentals aren't on a deluxe CD.... but... around December they will be with the making of DVD physical package
imogenheap,#firsttrainhome (get now) and #Ellipse (pre-order) up on iTunes USA and Canada. The rest of us have to wait until tomorrow (I'm buying one).
imogenheap,doing that head nodding thing when you really need sleep. Artwork is so so almost there now. Enjoying the clouds on this lovely afternoon
imogenheap,Seeing red. Apparently the front cover image I worked on for 5 hours on in the plane wasn't high enough quality. Have to try and do it again
imogenheap,On plane. Homeward bound. Straight into Sussex for album art when I land. Really enjoyed this trip. Looking forward to more of the same x
imogenheap,"With current TV filming in Griffiths Park, los feliz before flying back to London at 5 tonight x"
imogenheap,In a shop renting a projector. Nobody seems to be able to have the lead we need to connect laptop to projector for #heaptweetup. Tick tock!
imogenheap,Hotel Cafe in LA has an 21's only policy. I'm so so so sorry. I didn't know until just now. They won't back down about it. Oh wa! my bad.

imogenheap,@inElsie I only just thought about it.  Will do one in London when I get back x
imogenheap,Anyone know #nenbookworm of Flickr?Need to get approval of their image for album booklet asap. They're not replying to flickr messages. X x

imogenheap,Just about to take off. Caught a couple of zzzs in the cab. Got klong with me for easy snoozing. Looking forward to other side of the pond!
imogenheap,@helenhiccup Cod.. not in the sense of fish.. but a rubbish version of.... trying to be... but really not even nibbling the toes of at all.
imogenheap,@IvanRott  i thought it was pretty good so I OK'd it. I like hearing my songs in a new light. That song really does what it likes these days
imogenheap,"Found myself singing ""there's bunnies in the garden"", cod opera style. I skipped sleep coz I'm STILL clearing my bedroom/ packing! x"
imogenheap,Sitting in a car with the gorgeous @mikasounds listening to Little Bird. It's his fave. My new man fetish is the 50ft Take That ringleader.
imogenheap,@kokalola so I've heard! Looking forward to a night out. I'll be up all night packing after it but I can sleep on the plane :) xxx
imogenheap,From one extreme to another.In cab on route to see Take That at Wembley! Not coz I'm a closet TT fan. Fab Es Devlin's designed the show. x
imogenheap,@CelebzTrash  Don't even go there! Absolutely NOT!
imogenheap,James Cabooter has written an email in to my website saying it was intercepted. I don't want bad blood so let's leave it be. Moving on....
imogenheap,"mmm @bcouil. Equally though perhaps coincidentally Ebay took it down after all the messages everyone sent in. Either way, amazing response"
imogenheap,http://bit.ly/OruwB It's gone! An exciting day in the life of an #Ellipse promo album! That was some mad support there people. Thank you!!!
imogenheap,@paulvickeryuk he's pretty close to me too! I may stop by for tea myself! x
imogenheap,Waiting now to see if it does disappear off Ebay and how it got to be stolen/put up there with all those other suspect/ sealed/ promo items.
imogenheap,"RT @Zoots14: @imogenheap ""... stealing my promos. Management are in the process of removing it I believe"""
imogenheap,"RT @Zoots14: @imogenheap Just got a reply from James! ""I have been made aware of the situation and I can confirm it is not me but somebody.."
imogenheap,@jgpmolloy thank you x x
imogenheap,If I can't get it down in time and you won it @LinhN you can refuse to pay because it's an illegal listing. Might get bad feedback though!
imogenheap,@DaveGorman scary what you can find out about someone on t'internet!
imogenheap,RT @stereokillnet: New on Stereokill.net - Imogen Heap in 10m bid... for her own record (http://cli.gs/z15P4)
imogenheap,Yeah @EmLover3. Keep bidding by all means but make it look legit or else he'll remove you! Bet he's rubbing his hands. Soon kicking himself
imogenheap,thanks to @tdolby2001 http://bit.ly/RBdqF and @hdsander http://bit.ly/SUMOF for blogging about it. xxx
imogenheap,Aha! @thehideawayteam has posted a pic of James ***ooter from the Da** **ar paper. Otterly brilliant! xxx http://twitpic.com/9dq1e
imogenheap,I can't bid for it any more either!  http://bit.ly/61J6E For those of you that missed it at 5am GMT here's a grab. http://twitpic.com/9dxwj
imogenheap,"sooooo.... #Vinylvault has removed the ""idiot bidders"" for taking it to 10m and my ""superb 13 track"" #ellipse promo sampler sale is back on"
imogenheap,Could be slightly embarrassing for him if it is! #James***ooter. The paper he works for will hear of this! Tell tale! ner ner n ner ner
imogenheap,"In bed, thinking... Could James ???ooter be such a tool? Is that HIS ebay account? Look at those past auctions! It's got to be the journo!"
imogenheap,@kevmikwa  i don't do things by halves me! Right in there :)
imogenheap,Well that was fun! Will get it removed and make sure none of you get bumped off ebay for helping me out there. Love to you! Heap sleep now.
imogenheap,i just bid 10m (felt good momentarily) then was immediately outbid by Bidder 8. That is the maximum!
imogenheap,I know... @BurlyQEinstein. I'm feeling slightly on edge right now but it'll be fine. Must feel pretty mad to click ?m - place bid!
imogenheap,no no @leeredfern I meant fear not Bidder 8 coz It's not me.. but I will sort by morning. @passioneer is! (Thank you!!) Fun and games...xxx
imogenheap,holy bovine 5m! Have set up account (Ahem_Pigeon) Having issues verifying credit card to bid! Will sort by morning bidder 8! Fear not!!!!!
imogenheap,I'll get it removed @rio_ben. I doubt it's the journo who put it up there. He's just been careless with it. I'm gonna bid big on it for fun.
imogenheap,Will get it removed somehow @frostiblack. If people want to make it the most bidded on item ever on ebay in the meantime...  could be fun?
imogenheap,Thank you @wgeramb and thank you for the heads up about the auction too x x x
imogenheap,@CarFan_5801 may just do that.
imogenheap,@rio_ben I pressed up promo copies of the album and sent some to various people for review. He was one of them. He should know better
imogenheap,@dangennoe  that is proper cheeky! Will get on it m'dear! x
imogenheap,@brandonk99  I am trying up my boots as we speak.
imogenheap,@harrietbartlett  that would be some consolation :)
imogenheap,I guess someone's going to get it @lloydinspace. If you did... I'd very much appreciate it if you kept it to yourself until 24th August :)
imogenheap,Unbroken seal. He hadn't even listened to it! James ???ooter (easy to fill in gaps from our end) The cheek of it http://bit.ly/61J6E
imogenheap,yup @benfo. I'll be going into KCRW I think on this trip to play a couple of choons off the CD :) not live though.. not ready for that. x
imogenheap,"@benfo  release date for digital ""first train home"" will be by the end of the month."
imogenheap,@TexAxile  will take a parasol... I'm into parasols at the moment. I think there ought to be more of them in this world.
imogenheap,@andrewvansant  Will chase people on Canvas video. Lost the thread a little with so much going on. I know I keep saying soon.. but.. soon
imogenheap,@lynseynewton  My parrot on that occasion for Pop!Tech was sooperlooper - http://www.essej.net/sooperlooper/ x
imogenheap,Prepping/ packing for a week long LA/NY promo trip Monday morning. Been at the FTH video edit and doing more album art bits. xxx
imogenheap,We sorted the album cover finally. I have a hint of a smile in this one. A day of catch up/ emails/ tidying/ washing/ getting on top tmw x
imogenheap,ok... i take that back. Jon Hopkins' gig is sold out. Nice one Jon! Just spoke to Es. Going to see the First Train Home rushes on fri.
imogenheap,I don't think I'm going to make Jon Hopkins' gig tonight at the ICA. boo! there's a few tickets left. Go check him out if you're in London.
imogenheap,@duanetoops coz the one on the front cover at the moment is completely wrong. my chin is really weird. Too long a story to tweet.
imogenheap,Here with Richard Bull again BOY is it hot today. Whooo eee. Trying out a different head on my shoulders for the front cover. Not easy....
imogenheap,@randalltrandall  you're right. I do love that idea. WIsh I had a better connection here at the house. Thanks for link :)
imogenheap,I answered the door today to 20 people at 2.30pm and they've just left. Interview was good fun. Excited to see the documentary (out 2011!) x
imogenheap,hat is ... on how I and other people record their music. Apparently they're filming Brian Eno in the morning so I'm in very good company!
imogenheap,Eight people over tomorrow to film me in my studio as part of a George Martin documentary on recording techniques (???) Sleeeep now....zzz
imogenheap,"@wearereplenish posted this earlier on my youtube channel. Pieced together by @jusgoat. http://bit.ly/RFyGa It's the #Ellipse ""trailer"" xx"
imogenheap,http://twitpic.com/8sxzw - That'll be a wrap! We did it. Can't wait to see it after the 2 weeks of post they're gonna do on it. Woop!
imogenheap,On the way over to the First Train Home shoot. Listening to a double speed version to get those slo-mo lip syncs right xxx
imogenheap,"@IsamuMayuri  Soon'ish. 3rd Week of July. Trying to get you guys the Canvas video but for some reason the ""cogs"" got stuck. Will get on it."
imogenheap,Just drove back from Glastonbury. Got a 5.45am cab tomorrow to take me to the First Train Home video shoot. Again @Dan__Black was the man!
imogenheap,http://twitpic.com/8narl - Dawn at Glastonbury. Best set for me was Dan Black. F'in great!!!!!! xxxxx
imogenheap,http://twitpic.com/8krvl - Here at glastonbury. Learning @Shlomo's conducting signals for our improvised piece we're gonna do. S'gonna b ...
imogenheap,"Right... gonna pack tent, sleeping bag, wellies, tissues, print maps... and head on down to Glastonbury! A bit of MJ for the journey xxx"
imogenheap,@boomstai I didn't really take that tweet as a snipe at me. No sweat. It just has to be right. I annoy myself at how anal I can get.
imogenheap,@magic_monkey I just spent 2 years working toward having this finished. I don't care if only 1 person bought it. It has to be right for ME!
imogenheap,Yup... totally.. actually looking at those type of shots now. That was my initial idea but ended up veering toward more serious @Epiphany78
imogenheap,I am looking into camera! But for some reason (maybe the light reflecting in my eye from the shoot day?) it doesn't look like I am.
imogenheap,@ThreeWayJam  I was looking into camera! That's the weird thing. Maybe coz the light on my face from the shot is reflecting in my eyes?
imogenheap,@Nikebrand260  that is the problem. We've been round and round trying to make it work but it just doesn't. Love the composition/ light etc
imogenheap,"Problem - image I chose had shadows in other places. ""moved"" them to work with Ellipse light but now I look like I'm chewing something!"
imogenheap,This is the album cover but I'm changing it. Clear to me now. My hunch was confirmed by some of your responses! http://bit.ly/T4uJg thankyou
imogenheap,@anguaji  something's still not sitting right for me with it. That's why I haven't tweeted yet.
imogenheap,Heavy heavy heart and now the the rain! Glastonbury's going to be a total mudwashout. I actually thought it'd be sunny this year.
imogenheap,Noooooooo!!!! Michael Jackson was my childhood! I loved him. So so so so sad. So nearly saw him live. Just a couple of weeks. crying.
imogenheap,Oh my god!!! Have you heard?? Michael Jackson! Please please I don't want him to die. Arghh! Hang on Michael. It's not time! Oh!!!!
imogenheap,@notdarr  Canada same as US. 25th Aug x
imogenheap,@peterzimmerman  not sure yet... but if someone plays the glass harmonica they may have the upper hand
imogenheap,@soccerstar6v6 going to try release instrumentals the same time
imogenheap,@brandroidattack  yeah. I do want to do that. Definitely. There's almost a full album of extra non album tracks just from the last campaign.
imogenheap,@Mitholas  Yup. Somewhere there'll be lossless versions. Not sure if iTunes/Amazon/etc do that but we're looking into it. Stay twooned.  x
imogenheap,Hello @dustandair. Nop... no extra tracks. Going to put up the instrumentals digitally (for now) for small fee and poss a vinyl package too.
imogenheap,Hello. I'm here with Carol Hart at the flat and we're trying out hair and make up for the video shoot on Monday. TIme is tight on the day!
imogenheap,Just got back to the flat from doing the album artwork with Richard. Love driving at night when the streets are empty like a video game.
imogenheap,"Here with Richard again working on the album art. His cute dog on cushion, (she likes to get her teeth into my knee caps sometimes though) x"
imogenheap,"Now that I've finally put Ellipse to bed in my heart, mind, ears... I am now going to put myself to bed. Good night all x"
imogenheap,It was Ellipse @lifeserial. I'd been avoiding/ dreading listening to it for the Final final no going back approval. It felt right tonight.
imogenheap,"Went to a fave spot on the Southbank of the Thames, the sun set over the other. A beautiful evening. Headphones on. People watched."
imogenheap,Lots going on at the moment. Feeling below par. Finding it hard to make decisions and get it all done . Worrying about letting people down.
imogenheap,"Well, well petals. I think we have a front cover image :) woop! Richard's gonna try out some font/title ideas tomorrow. A good days work!"
imogenheap,@desired_waste  SHE (Es Devlin) never has! :) I saw the one film she's made (for Nitin Sawhney). Es is designing my stage set. She's amazing
imogenheap,At Richard Bull's taking pics of leaves in the garden to incorporate into the album artwork. Met Es Devlin earlier to discuss FTH video :) x
imogenheap,@coreydu thank you! I'm dreading/excited to hear peoples thoughts. It feels so soon already after Ellipse being in my hands all this time.
imogenheap,@sav_ 'Peking opera' and 'cardboard' were my faves. Next time say hello :) x x
imogenheap,"At the RFH listening to Leo Abrahams and oter musicians improvise and interpret words such as ""itch"" and ""rocket"". Leafcutter John gig. X"
imogenheap,Final vblog is up now. That makes 40! http://bit.ly/SWDWl @jusgoat is actually here now filming me tweet this. She never stops!!! x
imogenheap,Ok! Here is vblog #39! one more to come... just writing the blurb for that now.  http://bit.ly/R0WYy Thank you @jusgoat for doing these!!!
imogenheap,@obnoxiousweed  Doh! There's me thinking it might be interesting! I am singing you a song now... can you hear it?
imogenheap,Chris Weingarten is reviewing 1000 albums in 2009 via twitter. Check him out @1000timesyes.  This is why - http://bit.ly/ts19i
imogenheap,@nicholaswyoung  Looking into lossless online version yup. Be nice for people to hear it at 24 bit. That's how I hear it in my studio.
imogenheap,"@kirstenschuh  really? but they scratch, fall apart on opening and teeth holding CD break. I wanted to reinvent the Jewel case but no time!"
imogenheap,"@lollipopdaisy  bizarrely, plastic jewel cases are somehow cheaper to make. That's why most albums are jewel cases."
imogenheap,@jasonbees  Looking into vinyl versions yup. I'm not sure if I can get different formats out in time for 24th Aug though. Will see! xx
imogenheap,"What will probably end up happening is the first run 100,000 will be fancy then revert to Jewel case/ slip case. I hate jewel cases!"
imogenheap,The battle's begun! I emailed early packaging ideas to the labels. They think it's the Deluxe version whereas I want everyone to be special.
imogenheap,@benfo @jusgoat is working her little hooves off for you all on the vblog front. Tomorrow I'm sure xxx
imogenheap,@JoshLaForet Yup... t's gonna be a nice little package :) Front cover is almost there. A few hurdles to jump yet. x
imogenheap,Great album artwork session today. Lightening pace! Going to be contacting flickr people regarding the images we chose in the end now. x
imogenheap,Hello you lot. Am here with a young man named Richard Bull in Surrey conjuring up some beautiful album packaging for you! Coming together!
imogenheap,More artwork sorting today. Went to CSV (manufacturers) today to look at packaging ideas. Off to Surrey tmw to start laying it all out xx
imogenheap,"wow! Sitting here battling with emails, hayever and a mountainous pile of snotty tissues when 9 deer ran across the garden!! WoW! xx"
imogenheap,@desired_waste  still not 100% on which images we're using. There's a couple of 50/50's.
imogenheap,"Time for bed now, leaving a trail of tissues as I go, furry hot water bottle under my arm. Hot toddy in hand. hopefully sleep kick out cold"
imogenheap,Right! I've now signed and messaged on over 200+ promo #Ellipse CDs. These are full length ones. That took waaaay longer than I thought!
imogenheap,@djinfrared  I think it's brilliant!
imogenheap,@yagmurkaplan  oh dear! I will have to look at getting my soft tissues elsewhere then when I run out of these. Any recommendations?
imogenheap,thank the great tissue lord for Kleenex Balsam otherwise my nose and it's surrounding parts would be flaky red raw. The cold hath cometh.
imogenheap,@Steiny31 Best advice I got was from my dad. Always be polite. Don't let people down. Keep up your standards.  Buy things that will last.
imogenheap,"Just bought a load of card, pens, stanley life, gloss, pencils. Going to start cutting/pasting/drawing these pics together for the album art"
imogenheap,@londongal76  everywhere! hopefully.  x
imogenheap,@ForrestLupin  I already did. It's called Wait it out. But you gonna have to wait it out to hear it! mmm....
imogenheap,@Neriandal  Final cut pro.
imogenheap,"the lovely @jusgoat is working feverishly away at the new (and last in ""the making of"" series) vblogs as we tweet. Should be up wed. x"
imogenheap,wow! this rain isn't messing about! Woo hoooo!
imogenheap,"I wasn't here but Tom was. Thunder was right overhead and he said it was SOOO loud (gutted i missed it!). All 4 phones in the house, fried."
imogenheap,In other news... my house got struck by lightening today!
imogenheap,"So... erm..  my album is out 24th Aug. Slipping that out there, hoping nobody will really notice it's any later..It's not my fault... honest"
imogenheap,@matt_cochr  i do have a little 24bit edirol gadget but it's not HERE. darn it. I wasn't going to stay tonight but seeing Es Devlin tmw now.
imogenheap,"@dangennoe  I know! i missed it so much. Love having the doors open, lights out inside and letting the the city spill into my living room."
imogenheap,Wish I had some recording gear at the flat. The low dark flutter of this helicopter. The city night holds it's breath  beneath it tonight.
imogenheap,"Meeting @andyKWhau today at my flat to talk album art, packaging etc. Lovely day in London! Quad biking (not go karts!) was great fun! xx"
imogenheap,@jeremycowart sure x :)
imogenheap,Bed time! I've got to get up and go Go Karting in the morning for a friend's hen activity day. Loved Go Karting nr Coachella one year. x
imogenheap,Ah I see @jeremycowart  It's a lovely first interview! Pic looks fab in Billboard. @msutherlandUK was very sweet about Abigale (my car) too!
imogenheap,@ademtce  I don't think it's online yet is it @jeremycowart? Where did you find that page? x
imogenheap,Ah! nice! Here's one of the photos @jeremycowart took of me in LA last month. Thank you @msutherlanduk. Great piece! x http://bit.ly/o1T0k
imogenheap,@rio_ben  Tom shot the footage in Newfoundland. Looks really beautiful x
imogenheap,@alnya  He is of course amazing. I'm going to be making scores more videos in my time. T'would be lovely if our paths crossed.
imogenheap,@KaelaIsSoFly  I can't tell...  it's someone I'm already working with on something else... and turns out could well be perfect for FTH.
imogenheap,For First Train Home @Mitholas . That's when we have to have it delivered. Canvas is done. Just figuring stuff out then it'll go online x
imogenheap,"Going to meet up and discuss ideas this coming week. We have to have the ""video"" wrapped up for 1st July! That's a tall order!"
imogenheap,Sadly that director I was hounding to do First Train Home is neck deep in a commercial right now. Meantime something perfect has arisen ! x
imogenheap,"Just cooked lunch for a friendly business meeting here. It's all starting to go off! 33 emails, 8 missed calls. Tea, then attack!"
imogenheap,"@OysterBoy__ Artwork not done yet. Getting there. Just audio, track order etc. @andyKWhau won and also Ewan Robertson and Jennie Hancock. x"
imogenheap,@erwinthegreat  Brilliant! that's the reason I'm going  give in interviews as to why I named It Ellipse! It's kinda like an elongated circle
imogenheap,Can't believe in less that 10 hours I will have my master copy of Ellipse! Sweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet!
imogenheap,Just doing a short 1 min version of Swoon for possible TV spot. Just a pitch at the moment but looking good. x
imogenheap,Out shooting with @sarin in the woods where I jog. The other day stumbled across (not into thankfully) a nice swampy pond place. Looks great
imogenheap,Filmed a monster vblog with @jusgoat today. Will be up next week. T'as a big one coz It's been a while! Will let you know when it's up xxx
imogenheap,@austenmccally today I rediscovered Dover street Market. I walked in on the right day too! 40% off... Oh yeah baby. Feels good!
imogenheap,@dasmybaby oh dear! Hope you got some nice bits before that happened. Good news is you can carry on when your new one comes in the post :)
imogenheap,@imatoysruskid but of course!! Many many a brilliant thing! I may wear a few bits for vblog filming tomorrow :)
imogenheap,I really went for it today. Amazing impulsive shopping spree. That's what a girl needs to celebrate! New clothes for good times ahead x x
imogenheap,"Ooh! I've just seen the beginnings of the front cover coming to life. From in shower ""light bulb"" moment to seeing it on my screen. Love it!"
imogenheap,@lionl nop. It's a print of a painting the lovely talented Simon Henwood did.
imogenheap,ok found some heinz tomato soup in the cupboard. So many time that stuff's saved the day. I love my flat. It kinda feels like me 2 years ago
imogenheap,oh shit. I can't sleep. He'd better be free! argh! It's light now. I'm hungry and there's no food in the fridge (am back in my flat)
imogenheap,I think i've found my video director man. Fingers crossed on availabilty! will let you know when I do.... :) x time for sleep now. x
imogenheap,@bryan_coleman  yup still on the table. Just loaded with album artwork/video stuff now to get album out for August. x
imogenheap,@rio_ben  as long as the people who want get their hands on it/ would love it if they knew I existed....that's all I care about!
imogenheap,"@deshrewminor. The title ""2-1"" may make more sense when you listen to it.... though it may not. :)"
imogenheap,Hello all. Would you like to know the running order?? I changed the name of Polyfilla too.  http://www.imogenheap.com/  getting there! xx
imogenheap,ah yes @kaaregarnes. Mr. Turrell is a Top chap. We did a @hawksleyworkman video backstage together! have you seen it?  http://bit.ly/17enZh
imogenheap,@peachyoghurt  no... not as a duet. A few lines drift in and out. A small yet very beautiful parts. x
imogenheap,"@oliverkuster  @jusgoat and I are filming the final ""making of"" vblog series this Wednesday. Will continue to do vblogs/ ustream though x"
imogenheap,"@HimOverThere little things. Bass up on a couple, last few seconds on a couple more (the endings felt too abrupt) ""Clicks"" in little bird x"
imogenheap,@HimOverThere  I've revisited 5 mixes. On my rush to get the album done for the promos I missed a few things. So going to re master.  x
imogenheap,"Today deciding on final images for album artwork, looking at video director ""reels"", trying to compute after 2 years that the music is done!"
imogenheap,"Had the big thumbs up from Christiaan of @buddhamachine lovelinessnessness on between Sheets sample, SO... Next it's mastering take 2. Woop!"
imogenheap,"@toolgasm Cheeky mama! I don't go out, I don't watch TV, I haven't done anything BUT make this album! I tweet for 5 min brakes. Jeeeeeez"
imogenheap,"I've backed up to DVD, 1 external + 2 x internal hard drives. Can't be too careful! Heapsleep time. Busy day tomorrow :) xxx much love xxx"
imogenheap,@austenmccally That's good to hear. xx Sadly some people won't wait and their first listen will be ruined. See how long I can hold on to it.
imogenheap,@LOA_Studio  same as always. TLM 103. Used it for S4Y and now Ellipse coupled with an Avalon 737. If it aint broke! xx
imogenheap,"@Topher87  thanks for that! just let me relax for a couple of days before bringing that up? I guess sadly, it's inevitable in these times."
imogenheap,@benfo  so far so good. Got to finish artwork yet though. The shoot with @jeremycowart looked SOOOO good! Just got to choose (out of 1200!)
imogenheap,@darrenhayes  Do it!
