johncena,Damn I got a lotta free time. Now really going. See you.
johncena,"So it IS what it IS. Gay or straight. To quote ""Dwayne"", ""it doesn't matter!"""
johncena,Something like that as a persons flaw is about the most ignorant thing that can be done. Don't be that person. Step your game up.
johncena,But I now realize that it shouldn't matter what race creed color sexual preference age u are. If your good. You're good. Trying to pick....
johncena,No take it as is. Why should a persons sexuality matter? He is a great entertainer. I will admit. I have made some mistakes in the past...
johncena,"RT @chrispypan: @JohnCena shall we take that last tweet as a diplomatic ""yes""?"
johncena,That is the last one I will answer because of how ridiculous it is. My answer. Why should it matter?
johncena,RT @LovesTheMuffins: @JohnCena you think the rock is gay?

johncena,RT @JOHNCENAFAN85: @JohnCena I love fruity pebbles too and rock has been insulting your fans alot too
johncena,"Just stronger. So don't go and take that out of context. He is much quicker and probally a better overall athlete, but strength belongs 2 me"
johncena,"No shorting the Rock for all of his abilities ...but I can say with confidence, I am stronger than him. That does not make me better...."
johncena,RT @Miss_Imelda22: @JohnCena I've got a question for you...who do u think is stronger? You or @TheRock?

johncena,"It is available on amazon.com and is truly worth a look. A voice not unfamiliar is my favorite. Marc, I am so proud of you. Its brillant."
johncena,The book is called These Stone Skies and is truly a measure of how creative he really is. The poems were written between 93' and 04'
