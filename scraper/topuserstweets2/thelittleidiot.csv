thelittleidiot,@TheSTMagazine or: 'i'm going to follow you home and watch you while you sleep'. that'd be an awesome epitaph on a tombstone. #witterlive
thelittleidiot,@TheSTMagazine or 'i tired'. #witterlive
thelittleidiot,@TheSTMagazine my epitaph: i tried. #witterlive
thelittleidiot,@TheSTMagazine i will happily support major labels when all musicians have health care and employees are treated well. #witterlive
thelittleidiot,@TheSTMagazine also the record biz brought about its own downfall by promoting non-artists and charging too much for cd's. #witterlive
thelittleidiot,@TheSTMagazine to save the music biz: make better records. treat artists and employees and fans with respect. it's not so hard. #witterlive
thelittleidiot,@TheSTMagazine i wish him well. he's a huge popstar. i'm just a weird guy who does twitter interviews. #witterlive
thelittleidiot,@TheSTMagazine unless the success is accompanied by laddishness and class-a narcotics addiction and public disgrace. #witterlive

thelittleidiot,@TheSTMagazine during the bush years i was on a watch list so i was stopped often in airports. fun times. p.s: i'm not a muslim. #witterlive
thelittleidiot,"@TheSTMagazine oh, i forgot to add that i'm a muslim when i'm in american airports. #witterlive"

thelittleidiot,"@TheSTMagazine i'm a quantum physics loving taoist who loves the teachings of christ, buddha, and stewie from family guy #witterlive"

thelittleidiot,"@TheSTMagazine i'm wary of any human religion that claims to be 'right'. it's a 15,000,000,000 year old universe #witterlive"
thelittleidiot,@TheSTMagazinei have a strong aversion to competitive religions. battling spiritual beliefs seems to have nothing to do with god #witterlive
thelittleidiot,@TheSTMagazine also hangovers are charming and short lived when you're 20. when you're 40 they're foul and endless. #witterlive

thelittleidiot,@TheSTMagazine l.a is great as it's so cheap that artists can still live there. also i like being literally low on the foodchain #witterlive
thelittleidiot,@TheSTMagazine i like music regardless of where it resides. there's precedent for interesting music also having broad appeal. #witterlive
thelittleidiot,"@TheSTMagazine what a fun question, thanks. day job at the sun not working out? #witterlive"
thelittleidiot,@TheSTMagazine as long as people make interesting music i'm not too concerned which period is being revived. #witterlive
