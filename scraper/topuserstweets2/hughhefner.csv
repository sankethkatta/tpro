hughhefner,"""Rebel Without A Cause"" opened at the Astor Theater in New York on October 22, 1955. It was a blockbuster!"
hughhefner,James Dean died instantly. His legendary status thus assured.
hughhefner,"Driving his Porsche Spyder to Salinas, Dean collided with another car--2 hours after being cited for speeding--doing 75 MPH in a 45 zone."
hughhefner,"In an extreme irony, James Dead died in a car accident demonstrating the same kind of reckless abandon his character portrays in the film."
hughhefner,"On September 17, 1955, James Dean shot a TV commercial for the National Highway Safety Committee cautioning motorists to ""drive safely."""

hughhefner,"Nick Adams, who played ""The Rebel"" on TV, died the same year of a drug overdose. An apparent suicide."
hughhefner,Sal Mineo was murdered near his West Hollywood apartment in 1968.
hughhefner,"Many of the members of the young cast of ""Rebels""--including the 3 principals--were doomed to early, violent deaths."
hughhefner,"Warner Bros. execs were so pleased with the first few days shooting in black & white, they increased the budget & ordered color."
hughhefner,"In the title roles, studio executives actually wanted Tab Hunter & Jayne Mansfield (no joke), but Nicholas Ray wanted James Dean."
hughhefner,"Like many other projects, ""Rebel"" was shelved,& then revived in 1953 by Nicholas Ray, a director who specialized in alienation."
hughhefner,"But Warner Bros. had actually contemplated making ""Rebel Without A Cause"" right after the war, testing Brando for the role in 1947."
hughhefner,"Hollywood reflected this fascination with Marlon Brando's ""The Wild One"" in 1954."
hughhefner,"The fascination with alienated youth in the '50s began with J.D. Salinger's ""Catcher In The Rye"" published in 1951."

hughhefner,"A profile on the original blonde, Jean Harlow, and a pictorial on our fascination with blonde beauties appears in the December Playboy."
hughhefner,"Within five years, Harlow, herself, would be dead--a victim of kidney failure in June, 1937, at the age of 26."
hughhefner,"On September 5, Harlow's husband died, an apparent suicide, while ""Red Dust"" was still in production--just as Irene Selznick had predicted."
hughhefner,"On July 2,1932, one month after ""Red Headed Woman"" was released, Jean Harlow married her middle aged mentor, producer Paul Bern."
hughhefner,"With the success of ""Red Headed Woman,"" Harlow was rushed into ""Red Dust,"" with MGM's other rising star, Clark Gable."
hughhefner,"Parts of ""Red Headed Woman"" were cut by local censors throughout the country & the picture was banned in England. But the public loved it!"
hughhefner,"It didn't matter to the would-be censors. This film, & others like it, led to the censorship of the Production Code in 1934."
hughhefner,Thalberg added a montage of humorous moments at the start of the film to establish that this was intended as farce.
hughhefner,"When ""Red Headed Woman"" was first previewed, the audience didn't know what to make of the Harlow character."
hughhefner,"The final, great love of Harlow's life--before her untimely death in 1937--was William Powell, who reminded some of her mentor, Paul Bern."
hughhefner,"Harold Rosson was the cinematographer on the picture. After Paul Bern's death, Harlow fell into an affair--& married Rosson. It didn't last."
hughhefner,"When Paul Bern asked Irene Mayer Selznick what she'd think if he married Harlow, she said, ""You'd blow your brains out!"" And he did."
hughhefner,"Film critic Leonard Maltin calls Harlow, in ""Red Headed Woman,"" the ""sexiest performance in screen history."""
hughhefner,"Harlow played a shameless stenographer who, in the words of Time magazine, ""Cooed & screwed her way to the top--& got away with it."""
hughhefner,"At least that's what Thalberg said when the Hays Office objected to the film. ""She's a harlot,"" said the censors. ""A common little tart."""
hughhefner,"Harlow is sensational in ""Red Headed Woman."" An unrepentant sinner! Sexy! Scandalous! And hilarious, too--because this is a satire on sex."
hughhefner,It was the I'll-fated MGM producer Paul Bern who suggested Harlow for the role that would make her a star.
hughhefner,"Irving Thalberg originally purchased the property for Garbo, but she turned it down."
hughhefner,"""Red Headed Woman"" was a sensational novel written by Katharine Brush in 1931 & serialized by the Saturday Evening Post."
