pogue,Here's my first impressions of the new iPhone 5... http://t.co/HHHAdERe
pogue,"The new EarPods earbuds, which come with the new iPhone/iPods, STAY IN! (My ears lack the antitragus, the flap that holds earbuds in!)"
pogue,And the Apple show concludes with the Foo Fighters live... Available in 16 or 32 GB.  http://t.co/NsqfaY5n
pogue,"OK, that's it for Apple's news! New phone + new iPods. Nothing said about iPod Classic, iPad Mini, or the continuing iCloud mail outage. :)"
pogue,"New Nano, one model: 16gb ($150). Old iPod Touch, 16gb ($200) or 32 ($250). New Touch: 32gb ($300) or 64gb ($400). New iPods in October."
pogue,These new Apple EarPods will come with the new iPhone and iPods.
pogue,"Whoa. After 600 million earbuds shipped, Apple offers new ""earpods""--more bulbous earbuds. Said to fit more people better, + better sound."
pogue,One more thing about the new Touch: they're giving it AirPlay (wireless projection to your TV) and Siri! And choice of 5 colors.
pogue,"Huh! There's a tiny metal circle on the back of the new Touch. Push it, it pops up, so you can attach a wrist strap."
pogue,"The new iPod Touch now has a serious camera: 5 megapixels, flash, autofocus, f/2.4, panorama mode."
pogue,"New iPod Touch: aluminum back, bigger screen, Retina display, new connector. A5 chip (""up to 2x faster""). Thinner + lighter."
pogue,The new iPod nano has an FM radio that you can pause and resume. Cool! And video playback returns to the nano.
pogue,"New iPod Nano. Tall, thin, shiny metal, business-card sized. Full-height 2.5"" touch screen, @#$%@#$ new connector."
pogue,Apple has redesigned the music store and the iTunes app. HUGELY decluttered and nicely reconceived.
pogue,@JessJos Sept 21!
pogue,"CORRECTION: The iPhone 5 is $200, $300, or $400 (**16,** 32, or 64gb)."
pogue,"The iPhone 4 8gb is now free with contract; iPhone 4S 16gb drops to $100. The iPhone 5 is $200, $300, or $400 (8, 32, or 64gb)."
pogue,"Here we go: Apple changed the connector. All those millions of docks, chargers, cables--now won't fit. There's an adapter, of course."
pogue,iPhone 5: Improved vide stabilization. Up to 10 faces recognized. Can take photos while recording video! Front camera is now HD.
pogue,Phil Schiller is showing sample photos from the iPhone 5. They're impressive. The ocean looks bluer. Kids look happier. And panorama mode!
