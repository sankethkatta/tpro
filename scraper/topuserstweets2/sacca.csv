sacca,@gaberivera You're falling for a GOP rhetorical ploy. The President supports high tech immigration as one aspect of legal immigration reform
sacca,@gaberivera This approach isn't a surprise. The GOP has known this stance from day one. That's why they suddenly support tech immigration.
sacca,@gaberivera I know you aren't arguing that those companies have the overall interest of the country at heart.
sacca,@gaberivera Because punting on the undocumented worker issue makes a ton of economic sense. Turns out our country extends beyond California.

sacca,"@peterpham @uber As coverage gets better and better, that becomes more and more moot. In SF, pick up times are single digit minutes all day."
sacca,@drakkhen But it would then be too expensive for many of those who need the service most.
sacca,@ClaraJeffery Have you taken a minute to read up on UberX? Not Uber. UberX. It prices at the same rates as a cab. Just safer and better.
sacca,@ClaraJeffery @anildash Be careful making assumptions about what poort people do and don't have: http://t.co/3nEP04ad
sacca,"@anildash But, in this case, the political motivations are clear - the authors of the law laid them bare - prevent competition with cabs."
sacca,@anildash Happy to consider the government's goals. That's why Uber supports the rest of the sedan legislation being voted on tomorrow.
sacca,@bnkausik @Mrgreenjets @anildash That analogy would make some sense if the cabs committed to cover poor and dangerous hoods. But they don't.
sacca,@ClaraJeffery @anildash Don't jump to a conclusion until you read up on UberX the new discount Uber service that costs the same as a cab.

sacca,"@anildash I know you aren't defending DC and its Taxi Commission in the area of corruption, right? That's been covered in the news."
sacca,@anildash How does forcing UberX to charge 5x what a taxicab does result in anything short of higher prices and less coverage for the poor?
sacca,@anildash UberX adds a layer of security and accountability for riders and drivers creating a much safer transaction at cab-like fee levels.
sacca,@anildash I am sure you know how well-served by taxis poor and crime-filled neighborhoods are now.
