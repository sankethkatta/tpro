adamlambert,Broken English: I'm trying to read u.. It's confusing but soooo mysteriously sexy. Maybe words aren't the key. Communication through touch.
adamlambert,Naked Love: come on folks! Relax!! Chill! It ain't that deep- take a chance and express how u want. Strip away all the BS and get real.
adamlambert,Never Close Our Eyes: let's all stay in the moment and stay open to all possibilities. We have the power to create our reality.

adamlambert,My morning! www.997now.com/adamlambert
adamlambert,@reevecarney thanks Reeve!
adamlambert,@allakovalkova yeah Mika!! Another good example of falsetto.
adamlambert,@nieceyE another interchangeable term. Means the same thing.
adamlambert,It Will Rain by Bruno Mars is in chest voice. The only part that's falsetto is the OOOOh's. He has got one hell of a voice! Big fan.
adamlambert,"Another example of falsetto is the incredibly sexy jam ""Hypnotize U"" by N.E.R.D.  Pharrell werks that vocal out!"
adamlambert,@AidanMcEwan middle 8 and bridge are the same thing. Two different names. :)
adamlambert,Another GREAT falsetto singer is Justin Timberlake. He uses it all the time. And he's real good at it.
adamlambert,"@adamsminion the hook in WWFM is the line ""whattaya want from me"". The guitar plays it at the beginning and it's in a post-chorus."
adamlambert,"@adamsminion a hook is the catchy part that gets stuck in your head. Usually they're in a chorus, and sometimes they're elsewhere."
adamlambert,"@adamsminion ok! A bridge is the middle section of a song that is diff from the rest. the bridge in BTIKM starts w ""I get kinda dark""..."
adamlambert,@JoStBeans haha yes. The BeeGees sang most of their tunes in Falsetto.
adamlambert,"But if u wanna hear more great falsetto check out Jeff Buckley, Matthew Bellamy of Muse and Radiohead. :)"
adamlambert,Ok. Nuff of all that. I'm such a nerd.
adamlambert,"The difference isn't so much about the note being hit, it's HOW it's being hit. Bass/alto/tenor/soprano are vocal ranges."
adamlambert,BTIKM is def not falsetto. It's fuckin high! Def tricky. :) but it feels so great to wail that out. Cathartic.
adamlambert,"@AhhhAdam yes. Good example. The ""nervous"" line. But the big ""look right thru me aaaaand..."" was a belt."
adamlambert,"@CazGlambert_ only when it's high and really light. If its powerful and loud it's called a ""belt"" ""full"" or ""chest voice""."
adamlambert,"@PersianGlamDr on the last album i used falsetto in Broken Open, A Loaded Smile and the ""eyes baby eyes"" part of Music Again."
adamlambert,Haha this is fun. All you singers know exactly what I'm talking about.
adamlambert,"@nrhgardner naw I don't do much of a mix. (prob would be 'safer' for my voice, but..)"
adamlambert,"@lestermendez: @adamlambert BUT, when you do sing falsetto, its pure and utter win! hahah thanks Lester!!"
adamlambert,@go4itanywy that's called Vibratto. ;)
adamlambert,"One of my fav examples of a wicked falsetto is ""Kiss"" by Prince. A full tenor chest voice is ""Open Arms"" by Journey. get the distinction?"
adamlambert,...not to b rude - but it's so often used to describe my voice but I hardly ever use my falsetto. Jus' sayin'
adamlambert,"a lil music education moment: FALSETTO. It's not full, belted out chest voice. It's small, light pretty head voice. Widely misunderstood. :)"
