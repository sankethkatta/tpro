twitterapi,@jdiller Thanks for letting us know. Could you let us know what IP your requests are coming from? Thanks. ^MM
twitterapi,@gabek Why RSS and not atom ;-) ^MM
twitterapi,Lists can now be found by id or slug. There is also an atom feed for a list's statuses timeline. ^MM
twitterapi,@earth2marsh We want to support that. Requires some infrastructure changes though to make scalable. One day :-) ^MM
twitterapi,@jmathai If you're using the versioned URLs and getting different results than the non-versioned URLs please let us know. ^MM
twitterapi,@dan_jf Yes. Stay tuned. ^MM
twitterapi,@MatthiasKunze Retweets are stripped from the friends_timeline so sometimes the counts won't be exact. ^MM
twitterapi,@jmathai All resources in the API are accessible via the api.twitter.com/1 versioned url. So far though only the list API docs use them. ^MM
twitterapi,"@tzahi docs will be fixed - ""geocode"" param in the search API will also search the geotagged tweets ^RK"
twitterapi,@tzahi thanks for pointing that out! those docs will be fixed soon. both locations will be taken into account. ^RK
twitterapi,@tzahi you'll be able to search for geotagged tweets using the search API ^RK
twitterapi,List API deploy likely tomorrow will let you use list id/slug interchangeably & adds an atom feed for a list's statuses timeline. ^MM
twitterapi,"List API docs are up at http://bit.ly/4xFE8 now. Should be up to date though you can't yet find by list id, only slug. Not for long. ^MM"

twitterapi,"@dozykraut That resource uses the same updated cursoring API as described in its documentation. So ""page"" will have no effect. Use cursor."
twitterapi,@dozykraut statuses/followers isn't part of the documented API. What is it you want? The friends_timeline? Pagination works for that. ^MM
twitterapi,"@dozykraut In the case of followers/ids please see the documentation about the new ""cursor"" interface: http://bit.ly/WkHG0 ^MM"
twitterapi,@dozykraut I can't reproduce what you're describing: http://gist.github.com/204793 ^MM
twitterapi,@altinsel Use REST statuses/mentions or Streaming filter with track parameter. Search is probably the last option.
twitterapi,RT @twitter: Help uncover all the awesome Twitter apps out there on #appwednesday. We'll kick it off with @trendsmap @seesmic @tweetmeme ^RS

twitterapi,@dcbriccetti The retweet feature was recently darkmoded while we worked on pushing out some changes. Weirdness is likely at the moment. ^MM
twitterapi,@dcbriccetti Currently you should get a 404 on statuses/retweet as it is not generally available. ^MM
twitterapi,Some may have experienced pagination problems w/ the friends_timeline. It should be back to normal by now or within minutes. ^MM

twitterapi,Retweet API update: We're collapsing retweets so you don't have to & we're adding statuses/retweets resource http://bit.ly/9YxYP ^MM
twitterapi,@dcbriccetti That's a bug. It's been fixed and probably deployed Monday. It'll be the same as the other dates. Thanks for reporting it. ^MM
twitterapi,"@dcbriccetti This StatusInternal bug was fixed yesterday. Some cached versions may show the problem, but new statuses should all be OK."

twitterapi,"@jasoncrawford If you aren't comfortable giving the app the permissions they claim they need, then you should not use that app. ^DW"
twitterapi,You may see higher error rates in the API tonight. Please see the status blog: http://bit.ly/XLeQo ^DW
twitterapi,RT @oneforty: ready to open up @oneforty for a few more developers-they can sign up at www.oneforty.com then dm us their app name for access
twitterapi,@jasoncrawford OAuth has a read-only option when the application registers with Twitter.com ^DW
twitterapi,@chelseatheicon change your password. ^DW
twitterapi,@AndrewCurioso no ^DW
twitterapi,@tweetspinner we're working on that. It's a bug. ^DW
twitterapi,@Ed you are welcome! ^DW
twitterapi,@PS_ShortFest that is not possible. Accounts are independent and cannot be combined. ^DW
twitterapi,@sumoran9 you can goto their profile ^DW
twitterapi,"@jmathai there was an issue in the tracker a while back explaining that 500s are returned at the apache level, not in the code. ^DW"
twitterapi,"@jberkel you can use the API to get updated links periodically, but screen names rarely change so the link is almost guaranteed. ^DW"
twitterapi,"@timothymcmackin no, we do not expose that data in the api. ^DW"
twitterapi,@dryllen that is by design.  ^DW
twitterapi,@Crwth fixed the doc for blocks/blocking/ids. Thanks for the report! ^DW
twitterapi,@pdparticle why 150? ^DW
twitterapi,@Elusive_Angel try changing your password. ^DW
twitterapi,"@kriswallsmith the method works, but there are problems down stream in the code. We're working on getting those fixed. ^DW"

twitterapi,@jmathai well done! ^DW
twitterapi,@abraham test accounts are a developer's best friend. ^DW
twitterapi,@winrich we are discussing this internally now. changes possibly to come. ^DW
twitterapi,@winrich we only allow 15 requests per user per hour to account/verify_credentials. Check the docs! ^DW
twitterapi,"@destroytoday we only allow 15 requests per user to account/verify_credentials per hour. After that period, you get a 401 with that error."
twitterapi,"@haruny yes, should be releasing it today. ^DW"
twitterapi,@glazou this is a huge abuse vulnerability ^DW
twitterapi,@semifor interesting. Discussing this point now. ^DW
twitterapi,"@shomas Quick Google for ""llHTTPRequest twitter"" turned up http://bit.ly/1cdPAd  try that call and let me know ^MS"
twitterapi,"@DanimalAllen No mobile version yet, but we're working on it: http://bit.ly/Mui6J ^MS"
twitterapi,@shomas update.css is invalid (.xml or .json only). Does llHTTPRequest support user:pass? You may need to set the Authorization header. ^MS
twitterapi,"@glazou We used to do that, and people asked for more so they could use less of the rate limit requesting profiles. Saves on caches too. ^MS"
twitterapi,@danbenjamin Check out the information at the bottom of our roadmap: http://bit.ly/EfhyK ^MS
twitterapi,@Sleeping_Troll trends is json only. Check out the docs at http://bit.ly/mkbei ^MS
twitterapi,Compiling the 200+ tweets responding to our earlier question. I'll publish the report tomorrow. Keep the ideas coming - never too late! ^DW
twitterapi,@tonylogan2006 yes. It's either that or remove the widget. ^MS
twitterapi,"@tonylogan2006 yes, that would cause it. That is why I asked about what changed :)  ^MS"
twitterapi,@tonylogan2006 remove the widget to stop the popup. To show the tweets on a public site you need to go public w/ the account. ^MS
twitterapi,@tonylogan2006 Were you always protected? looking at the 'View Source' I see that your blog has widget pulling @tonylogan ^MS
twitterapi,"@tonylogan2006 that widget requests data for @tonylogan, who is protected. That requires a password and always should have. ^MS"
twitterapi,"@tonylogan2006 did you by chance add that twitter.com widget yesterday, or change anything else? ^MS"
twitterapi,@tonylogan2006 let me know the site & when this began (matt AT twitter.com). My guess: have a flash or JS widget calling the API. ^MS
twitterapi,Really great responses to what you would do if you worked on the API. I'm going to roll all of these up in a document and share. ^DW
twitterapi,Some great (and funny) suggestions are coming in http://bit.ly/jJZtX. What about really innovative stuff? What haven't we thought of? ^DW
twitterapi,@santosh79 can you give a more concrete example of how this would work? I'm not sure I follow what changes you would like us to make. ^DW
twitterapi,"@g1smd for the search API? try ""search_term -from:USERNAME"" which will return everything with ""search_term"" not from USERNAME ^DW"
twitterapi,@nicktelford what type of data and why? ^DW
twitterapi,@ljharb depends on if you use read or read-write permissions ^DW
twitterapi,"If you worked at Twitter on the API team, what would be the first project or feature you would tackle? ^DW"
twitterapi,@zambonini glad you noticed! ^DW
twitterapi,@ron_d_aron check your password so they can't update your timeline ^DW

twitterapi,@matthewfl try the search API. ^DW
twitterapi,"@jraines the wiki is not publicly editable. Do you have content you want to add? If so, what and where? ^DW"
twitterapi,@zambonini Should be resolved. Thanks for bearing with us! ^AP
twitterapi,@Fokker680 That's because user_timeline is only for your updates. friends_timeline has your friends' updates. ^AP
twitterapi,@stevesmename The cache of your user info probably hadn't expired yet. ^AP
twitterapi,@gregavola Not to our knowledge. Perhaps you requested whitelisting and it went through? ^AP

twitterapi,"@benmarsh A known issue, working on it. ^AP"
twitterapi,@MKais sounds like the IP provided is not the IP we are seeing. Could there be a network box in the middle changing the IP upstream? ^DW
twitterapi,"@znmeb it varies, but around a week at the moment. ^DW"
twitterapi,@MKais Could you use a service like http://www.whatismyip.com/ to confirm your IP is the same as the whitelisted one? ^MM
twitterapi,@otaviofff Really impressive results. Is this a friends of friends intersect algorithm at work? ^DW
twitterapi,@rckenned will pass that solution on to the engineer. Thanks for the suggestion. ^DW
twitterapi,@vuongat we are currently working on problems with the favorite logic ^DW
twitterapi,@Mitchell1969 we like the fact that there are asynchronous relationships so from a product standpoint we're OK with not including that ^DW
twitterapi,@ThorstenSuckow can you create a new issue in the Google Code list for this? ^DW
twitterapi,@pedroh96 try without the # ^DW
twitterapi,"@voituk yes, we moved to 150 a few weeks back. Check the change log on apiwiki.twitter.com! ^DW"

twitterapi,@chillspanyc please change your password which should prevent them from updating your stream. ^DW

twitterapi,"@mrblog that's sweet. I just re-followed 2 people because of you ""hack"". ^DW"
twitterapi,"Do any photo sharing sites allow multiple pics uploads (e.g. multiple email attachments), which are stitched together before tweeting? ^DW"
twitterapi,@recentsearch All of the data we expose is included in the API docs. Please see the URL in my profile. ^DW
twitterapi,@3Easy statuses/friends does not require authentication as friends lists are public. ^DW
twitterapi,@wymesei we no longer offer an XMPP feed. ^DW
twitterapi,Oh geez... http://thrdl.es/~/28S. So very Twitter to nominate a bug for #twittertees. Thanks @utunga. ^DW

twitterapi,"@cheesefinder we all write bugs, including me ^DW"
twitterapi,@r1cky well do share. ^DW
twitterapi,What+are+you+coding+right+now%3F
twitterapi,"@jaejoo yes, the API is very stable and OAuth security issues have been resolved. ^DW"
twitterapi,We are currently troubleshooting some architectural issues which are contributing to API latency. We appreciate your scripts' patience. ^DW
twitterapi,"@khrabrov json, but we are not religious ^DW"
twitterapi,"@Mobasoft I'll file a ticket internally but as this is not in the API domain, I can't do anything for you myself given other priorities. ^DW"
twitterapi,@Mobasoft on twitter.com? Or through the API? ^DW
twitterapi,Using statuses/update with interesting content will increase follower count. Guaranteed. This is in reply to @hastendeveloper's question ^DW
twitterapi,"@khrabrov json, because the over-the-wire size of the data is smaller. ^DW"
twitterapi,@ChrisKnowsBest This is a known issue. Please star this related issue http://bit.ly/h17Jk to receive updates as it is fixed. ^DW
twitterapi,"@jameseliason Please star http://bit.ly/FPovy

twitterapi,@Raptor235 there are some database issues that are result in 500s. What methods are you using? ^DW
twitterapi,@romanv yes. ^DW
twitterapi,@mattparrett was told by the backend folks working on 451 that the issue was fixed. Will look into 598 a little later in the week. ^DW
twitterapi,@twindexx we're working on mobile sign up pages so let's wait to see what comes from that effort and work from there. No ETA available. ^DW
twitterapi,"@twindexx there is no account creation available via the API, so there is no way around going to our sign up page. ^DW"
twitterapi,@zefonseca direct_messages/sent documentation updated. Thanks for the correction. ^DW
twitterapi,@jcsalterego fixed that typo. Thanks! ^DW
twitterapi,@AdamHertz depends. What are you sending now that is giving you the error. The URI you sent me was correct. ^DW
twitterapi,@ncreations what does traffic have to do with request limit. how are they connected in your case? I need the full story. ^DW
twitterapi,"@glazou if the user is protected, only the status object is omitted without credentials. I'll update the docs to make this more clear. ^DW"
twitterapi,"@Dasleah with the search API, you can use the since: and until: search operators to limit the day(s) of results to return. ^DW"
twitterapi,@ncreations create an account to follow those 100 people. Then use statues/friends_timeline to access their aggregated tweets. ^DW
twitterapi,@AdamHertz are you getting an error message in the reply? Could be follow limits (see: http://bit.ly/epN5U) ^MS
twitterapi,"Re: new reply changes  @twitterapi puts the name later if it's something other might be interested in (thanks, @jbradforddillon)  ^MS"
twitterapi,@PoNx if the owner of the replied-to tweet is not in the message the reply_to_status_id is removed. ^MS

twitterapi,@tomc1995 what are you seeing? ^DW
twitterapi,@vsr this is a site for @twitterapi content only. Not the Twitter specific issue you may think I was referring to. ^DW
twitterapi,"@vsr I'm working on a solution for that, actually. ^DW"
twitterapi,"@danivalentin no, you will have to use the status_id to perform a look up with statuses/show ^DW"

twitterapi,Some word from @biz on the recent replies change: http://bit.ly/E2RfC ^DW
twitterapi,@mostlygeek Have you read our information on rate limiting? http://apiwiki.twitter.com/Rate-limiting ^DW
twitterapi,"@skizzy203 changes take time, so we appreciate your patience. You can always try spritzer: http://bit.ly/dQyIj ^DW"
twitterapi,@stuartgibson the API was still working & it prevents people from needing to ask later on. We also updated http://status.twitter.com.  ^DW
twitterapi,"@CaffeinatedDave the API was still working. Additionally, it's preemptive so that people don't have to ask if we're down. ^DW"
twitterapi,@mikerlewis that is not a development priority right now. ^DW
twitterapi,We're experiencing unscheduled downtime: http://bit.ly/16C7fs ^DW
twitterapi,The data mining feed is down after some db schema changes from yesterday's maintenance weren't reflected in the feed's code. ^DW
twitterapi,"@PaulKinlan yes, since they result from the same IP address. ^DW"
twitterapi,"@dev_ralph you can set up a queuing system on your end, and push the updates when appropriate. As I said, we don't offer that feature. ^DW"
twitterapi,"@dev_ralph no, we do not offer a queuing service to deliver tweets on a delay. ^DW"
twitterapi,@PaulKinlan that sounds an awful lot like rate limiting. ^DW
twitterapi,@zigdon visible if the @reply is not at the start of the tweet. ^DW
twitterapi,@benburkert having a look. Thanks. ^DW
twitterapi,"@hulk11 these are all known issues, please check the issues list for status. ^DW"
twitterapi,@richardjohansso search the development group. This has been covered before. ^DW
twitterapi,@PaulKinlan is that app being rate limited?  ^DW
twitterapi,@kenwaln I'm trying my best to keep everyone in the loop. Glad to know it's paying off. ^DW
twitterapi,Received word that the hardware problem is under control. Queues are emptying so things should be on their way back to real-time. ^DW
twitterapi,There are hardware problems on the back end machines. You'll notice delays in timelines and search until while this is being fixed. ^DW
twitterapi,@satoko @ninoo we want to give a face to the tweets. ^DW
twitterapi,"@tweetcounter yes, set the in_reply_to_status_id parameter with statuses/update http://bit.ly/m5MLo ^DW"

twitterapi,"@aliebs updated the permissions, thanks for the notification. Sorry for the inconvenience. ^DW"
twitterapi,RT @dougw: We learned a lot http://bit.ly/SSanc
twitterapi,"@thomasafine yes, you are correct, we 'trim' so it has to be a non-space, space. ^DW"
twitterapi,@cwalcott see: http://bit.ly/OuOP6. I need to talk to the team about how we want to document this. ^DW
twitterapi,@aliebs you can find the graphics for Sign in with Twitter here: http://bit.ly/14vZxy ^DW
twitterapi,@empty_space @jalada less than 3% actually changed it. There is a lot of complaining from users that never opted to see all @replies. ^DW
twitterapi,"@ilowe I consider this constraint a feature. *Most* users don't want to see the answers to random questions, they just want critical updates"
twitterapi,@thomasafine a space is enough to turn a @reply into a mention. ^DW
twitterapi,I make sure that anything of general interest does not start with an @reply as to reach every follower. Always have and always will. ^DW
twitterapi,We perform maintenance in the middle of the day to ensure our engineers are awake and alert. Our plan for unexpected problems @couchsessions
twitterapi,"Please also send @mzsanford sweets. The ""Twitter Seattle Office"" needs love, too. ^DW"
twitterapi,Just a reminder: there is planned maintenance set to begin in 30 minutes or  around noon Pacific. It should last around an hour. ^DW
twitterapi,@ollieparsley still seeing this error? under what conditions? ^DW
twitterapi,@tothbenedek no because we use the same data twitter.com uses. ^DW
twitterapi,@fczuardi in_reply_to_status_id does not affect tweet display. ^DW
twitterapi,@yusukeyamamoto the documentation for blocks/exists is incomplete. Correcting that now. ^DW
twitterapi,"Got a congratulations on our impending *signed* (correction) int limit breakage. We accept all cakes, pies and brownies at the @twoffice."
twitterapi,"@jeffreymcmanus yikes, signed int. The missing extra bit is key! ^DW"
twitterapi,"Just met with the @cotweet guys to provide feedback. @al3x, @mzsanford and @dougw use their product to answer the Twitter API questions. ^DW"
twitterapi,@dgoemans see the roadmap for future API plans: http://bit.ly/EfhyK ^DW
twitterapi,"Check your database table definitions, status ids are about to roll over the maximum unsigned int: http://bit.ly/kokvi ^DW"
twitterapi,@senkorasic we will not be offering a call to replace the removed @replies option in the API. ^DW
twitterapi,@twindexx if they are consious of the change and want to share. Most clients place @user at the front like I'm doing here naturally. ^DW
twitterapi,"The tweets will still flow @twindexx. In a parallel universe, Twitter made the same change and didn't tell a soul. And no one noticed. ^DW"
twitterapi,"@twindexx yes, only @replies (tweets starting with @user) to unfollowed recipients are affected. Mentions are still included. ^DW"
twitterapi,@brettq The API reads data from Twitter.com which owns that change: http://bit.ly/HhRBT. Sorry to disappoint but much &lt; 5% used it. ^DW
twitterapi,We have closed the public_timeline profile issue: http://bit.ly/mRuvu. Big thanks to @rk for writing the fix. ^DW
twitterapi,@mikeziri blocking users and sending screen names to @spam helps us purge spammers automatically ^DW
twitterapi,"@bladnman yes, as mentioned the link I previously sent you. ^DW"
twitterapi,"@geek3point0 no, we do not support that. We'd prefer you move to OAuth for authentication. ^DW"
twitterapi,@TwitDash your email bounced ... twice. ^DW
twitterapi,@bladnman source attribution happens with updates sent through OAuth apps: http://bit.ly/raeyN ^DW
twitterapi,@bladnman what exactly are you trying to do? OAuth registration is at: http://twitter.com/oauth_clients ^DW
twitterapi,@Stecki we send out a message during the downtime but don't have pre-emptive logic in the site at the moment. Adding to the roadmap... ^DW
twitterapi,"@geek3point0 send the password as a MD5 has where, to do what? ^DW"
twitterapi,You guys retweet maintenance downtime like champs. I love it! Gets the word out ... thanks for the help. ^DW
twitterapi,Planned maintenance on Wednesday noon Pacific: http://bit.ly/15Uzfa ^DW
twitterapi,@MediaMilitia always doing what I can to keep the tweets flowing ^DW
twitterapi,@MediaMilitia I have fixed the problem. New tweets should appear in search now. ^DW
twitterapi,@abrahamvegh it is something we are thinking about to be developed within the next month. ^DW
twitterapi,@viniciusdelemos The to_user_id/from_user_id differences are noted in the search API documentation: http://bit.ly/XYEjd ^DW
twitterapi,@buzzkills Have you reviewed the rate limiting article: http://apiwiki.twitter.com/Rate-limiting ^DW
twitterapi,"@buzzkills not sure what a ""thick client"" is but we intend to address the desktop/iphone OAuth experience before deprecating basic auth ^DW"
twitterapi,@abrahamvegh news on what? I have a lot of conversations so you can't rely on pronouns :) ^DW
twitterapi,@abraham fixed that document defect. Thanks for the help. ^DW
twitterapi,@SwaroopH why do you prefer our API? ^DW
twitterapi,@bryanburgers woops. Fixing that right now. Thanks! ^DW
twitterapi,@DavidGosse can you exercise the new methods as a quick smoke test since you have all that data :) ? ^DW
twitterapi,@asciilator we don't expose that data via the API. ^DW
twitterapi,Blocking just became more fun. Announcing new methods to play with your blocking data: http://bit.ly/86joM ^DW
twitterapi,"@chockenberry yeah, don't worry about support being dropped. Just wanted an inventory of iPhone usage. ^DW"
twitterapi,Thanks for the responses of iPhone public_timeline use. ^DW
twitterapi,@zvancouver_com we're not removing support. Just taking an inventory of use cases. ^DW
twitterapi,Are there any iPhone apps that use the public_timeline? This is important so please speak up! ^DW
twitterapi,Announcing the impending deprecation of &lt;following&gt; and &lt;notification&gt; elements from API user objects: http://bit.ly/D4t2P ^DW
twitterapi,@kevdiff we like to think that we have just started growing. ^DW
twitterapi,@jonoabroad by numbers and it looks like you've hit the limit. ^DW
twitterapi,@twindexx please contact me off list: http://bit.ly/2I2SA ^DW
twitterapi,@FollowWatch can you file a Google Issue for this? ^DW
twitterapi,@arcain you can email me off list: http://bit.ly/2I2SA ^DW
twitterapi,The maintenance window previously planned will be rescheduled: http://bit.ly/q7mzF ^DW
twitterapi,@drewpca thanks for the report. Both friends/ids and followers/ids have been updated. ^DW
twitterapi,@vsr can you be more specific on what is broken with trends? This is the first report I have seen. ^DW
twitterapi,@baskar_dashgo this is not a data point we collect on Twitter.com which means it cannot be offered through the API. ^DW
twitterapi,"If you use the public_timeline API method and noticed it stopped this weekend, thank @stevej for getting the sevice running again. ^DW"
twitterapi,@twindexx it is not for sale. seriously. ^DW
twitterapi,"@abrahamvegh yeah, it's a limitation. I'll speak with the team Monday. ^DW"
twitterapi,The public_timeline is stuck. Drats! Notifying the authorities... ^DW
twitterapi,@twindexx add another IP address to your system and request whitelisting for that new address. ^DW
twitterapi,@aprettyrock use statuses/update. The object returned is the new status. So the status_id in that returned object is the latest status. ^DW
twitterapi,@abrahamvegh no ... we are seeing more interest in favorites recently so we'll think about some new methods for that data soon. ^DW
twitterapi,@NeoCat This is a known issue. ^DW
twitterapi,@buzzkills we do not give a specific number of Search API calls Please be judicious in your use. ^DW
twitterapi,@rusanu thanks for the report. I'll have that fixed. ^DW
twitterapi,@gissmog no. we do not offer sorting in chronological order for timelines. ^DW
twitterapi,"@paulsingh I don't need to rate tweets, I need to approve or disapprove and have the approved tweets queue for display/distribution. ^DW"
twitterapi,@Twunami What is your Permissions Suite? ^DW
twitterapi,@jalada can you email me the details? ^DW
twitterapi,@ShawnMilo the next major release of the API will use UNIX epoch time for all timestamps. We obviously can't change this on the live API ^DW
twitterapi,@tadwook I'm writing an email to the development group about issues 419 and 474 now. Will update the status there once I send it out. ^DW
twitterapi,@dmeiz known issues 419 and 474. ^DW
twitterapi,@WebTechies thanks for the present. Think I'll enjoy a nice malt beverage later :) ^DW
twitterapi,@TamuraJones thanks for passing this along. opening a dialogue with the owner accordingly. ^DW
twitterapi,"If you are doing something remarkable in the live moderation space where I could manually approve/disapprove tweets, please get in touch."
twitterapi,"@hsl This is a known problem, please see issues 419 and 474. ^DW"
twitterapi,@brettq can you open a request for a favorites feed method: http://bit.ly/ZCxFQ  ^DW
twitterapi,@dparnas that data is an asset. It may be available but not we need to figure how vital it is to our business before doing so. ^DW
twitterapi,@jeffsonstein thanks for sharing!  ^DW
twitterapi,@icodeforlove great idea ... link issues to doc pages. Will do. ^DW
twitterapi,@sanjay yes. ^DW
twitterapi,"@iPhoneDevGuy no, there are no new data mining methods. ^DW"
twitterapi,"@Getox Right, but I'd like to see how it does that. ^DW"
twitterapi,@sanjay 600 statuses per minute over 20 per minute. ^DW
twitterapi,@ikongsgf that's in the FAQ. ^DW
twitterapi,@sanjay because you made it seem like you were looking for a temporary fix to the public_timeline issues. ^DW
twitterapi,@g1smd good point. Next time! ^DW
twitterapi,"Planned site maintenance Friday, May 8th 2PM-3PM PST and Monday, May 11th Noon-1PM PST: http://bit.ly/cNiGG ^DW"
twitterapi,@thomasafine no and due to the scaling and performance reasons it will be a while before we can offer such a search. ^DW
twitterapi,@robinsloan I would enjoy seeing what you come up with. Visualizers are a popular topic around the office. Knock our socks off! ^DW
twitterapi,"@Getox no, I just don't want to take the time to sign up without seeing why it is worth my time ;) ^DW"
twitterapi,"@jtkendall the method will return all ids. However, known bug, you will get a 502 timeout for some users if their list is too large ^DW"
twitterapi,Handling the queue of nearly 100 data mining requests. Some good projects in the list... from academics and consumer apps. ^DW
twitterapi,@Getox I'd like to see what I'd get if I went through the signup process on the homepage. ^DW
twitterapi,The public_timeline feed is now fixed. Data away! ^DW
twitterapi,@teemus no. ^DW
twitterapi,@sanjay I'll take care of that defunct source parameter. Thanks for passing it along. ^DW
twitterapi,@pageoneresults Thanks for passing this along. We need to come up with a policy on this type of site. ^DW
twitterapi,"@Jesse that setting only affects your friends_timeline. Click the ""what's this"" link to learn more. ^DW"
twitterapi,@twfeed I think that's a memcached pool warming up. I'll make sure it's not something more problematic. ^DW
twitterapi,"http://twitpic.com/4q7bu - @jesse, change this setting to match mine. You'll only see my non-@replies. More signal, less noise."
twitterapi,@geoffim the borked timeline is being fixed :) ^DW
twitterapi,@Jesse you can always use twitterfeed.com to tweet changes from the announcement list http://bit.ly/7Pmkq if you just want updates. ^DW
twitterapi,@seiz check out issues 474 and 419. ^DW

twitterapi,@mbruce_ecnext look at the users/show method and http://bit.ly/nsfsi ^DW
twitterapi,@tothbenedek it is not currently available for outside consumption. ^DW
twitterapi,@benburkert Thanks for the report. We're waiting on some operations folks to get in the office. It will be fixed shortly. ^DW
twitterapi,@MisterGlass I'm not seeing a record of your whitelisting. Can you please reapply? ^DW
twitterapi,"@ev @mikeluby passed this along: dm ""status ua 863"" to @myflightinfo. ^DW"
twitterapi,@MisterGlass has your account been whitelisted? Are you including your account credentials with api calls? Double check your IP address. ^DW
twitterapi,"@ev @mikeluby passed this along: dm ""status ua 863"" to @myflightinfo. ^DW"
twitterapi,@sanjay it's not going to be fixed today. I can email you when we look into it. I'd check the protected element at runtime. ^DW
twitterapi,@sanjay thanks for the report. we're taking a look. ^DW
twitterapi,"Looks like @ev could use an app: http://twitter.com/ev/status/1720168679. Flight status from a tweet, anyone working on it? ^DW"

twitterapi,@TechAficionado we are working on this. please be patient. As I have told you before please watch the issue for updates: http://bit.ly/Ef9U3
twitterapi,@neilco coming soon! ^DW
twitterapi,"@bitrocker We realize that is missing and are going to include it in: http://bit.ly/viD4K
 ^DW"
twitterapi,@jonoabroad there is an issue open for this. checking into it. ^DW
twitterapi,@leporeloeu are you passing in your credentials with the request? ^DW
twitterapi,"@Hsilamot sure, we offer an array of methods, check the documentation http://apiwiki.twitter.com ^DW"
twitterapi,"@twequency no, everyone is subject to the same pagination limit ^DW"
twitterapi,@jeffsonstein user_ids are never reused. They are the permanent identifier for an account that remains unique forever. ^DW
twitterapi,@jeffsonstein most people never change their screen_name. Set the cache expiry to something like 1 day and your app will function well. ^DW
twitterapi,@jeffsonstein right on! Would love to see a blog post describing the basic architecture that we could point to. ^DW
twitterapi,@jeffsonstein we encourage you to set up a write-through cache of user objects for your application to read from. ^DW
twitterapi,@jeffsonstein That is a Common Request: http://bit.ly/EfhyK ^DW
twitterapi,Launch your app at @140tc: http://bit.ly/bml8s ^DW
twitterapi,@jschairb look at the max_id parameter for a given timeline method. ^DW
twitterapi,@spot23net we are working with Twittermass developers. Thanks. ^DW
twitterapi,@aloncarmel2k it is not currently possible. ^DW
twitterapi,@leporeloeu are you following the user? ^DW
twitterapi,@jeffsonstein create a local cache of user objects with users/show to translate IDs to screen_names. ^DW
twitterapi,@remzz Please email me with the details requested in http://apiwiki.twitter.com/Rate-limiting ^DW
twitterapi,@buzzkills nothing too dramatic. The returned data is slightly different. trends/current is a newer method. ^DW
twitterapi,"@gvjordan ""from MyApp"" is appended automatically for OAuth clients http://bit.ly/raeyN ^DW"
twitterapi,@JonathanNelson Please see http://apiwiki.twitter.com/Rate-limiting ^DW
twitterapi,@sunilgarg currently you cannot. Can you create a new defect for us here: http://bit.ly/ZCxFQ ^DW
twitterapi,Search indexing is currently running behind. It's a problem and we're working on it. ^DW
twitterapi,"@sarperdag no, we do not give user email addresses or phone numbers via the API. ^DW"
twitterapi,@rantav Do you have a working demo of this available? ^DW
twitterapi,@dpkendal that will be fine. ^DW
twitterapi,@jonsel that popup is normal. we require authentication to access your friends_timeline. ^DW
twitterapi,"@trackmyeps sure, we use javascript to provide a char count at twitter.com ^DW"
twitterapi,Has anyone developed drop-in JavaScript code that includes a char count and update window for Twitter applications? ^DW
twitterapi,@angsuman application registration is found at http://twitter.com/oauth_clients ^DW
twitterapi,@dpkendal what frequency are you planning to have the script update? ^DW
twitterapi,@jonsel do you have any browser plugins installed? ^DW
twitterapi,@BrianHall nothing in particular. I'll make note of it we'll make sure to fix this inconsistency in the next major release. ^DW
twitterapi,@Twunami Any methods not in the official documentation are not supported and could be changed without warning. Proceed with caution. ^DW
twitterapi,@dimebrain this is a known issue. Check the Google Code list. ^DW
twitterapi,@ollieparsley whitelisting is account or IP based. ^DW
twitterapi,@attilacsordas we do not index on '$' which means it is not searchable. ^DW
twitterapi,@twindexx follower limits cannot be raised. Why do you need to follow so many people? ^DW
twitterapi,@Twunami What do you think we do? Would love to talk about the market you think we are trying to create. ^DW
twitterapi,@jas_m 1 search every 5 minutes is well within the Search API limit. No worries of blacklisting. ^DW
twitterapi,@dpkendal The RSS feed for your friends_timeline requires authentication because the timeline often contains updates from protected friends.
twitterapi,@Kerk you get 100 calls per hour. 1 call per request means you use 1 credit per request. ^DW
twitterapi,@BrianHall can you give more information with the problems you're seeing with statuses/destroy? ^DW
twitterapi,@sushantanand the search method: http://tinyurl.com/cbpjbf ^DW
twitterapi,"@gissmog yes, you have to delete multiple statuses with serial requests to statuses/destroy ^DW"
twitterapi,"@diogodelgaudio yes, statuses/update performs the functionality of the update box on twitter.com ^DW"
twitterapi,"@al3x, @dougw, and @anamitra are speaking at the 140 conference: http://parnassusgroup.com/twitterconference/ ^DW"
twitterapi,@lakshmivyas Computers are cheap and parsing retweets client-side involves one simple regular expression. Data however is invaluable. ^DW
twitterapi,@lakshmivyas Why? They retweet data is valuable to some developers. Clients/applications can always strip them out client side. ^DW
twitterapi,@DavidGouge That is a common request: http://tinyurl.com/csk8qu ^DW

twitterapi,@TechAficionado We are aware of this defect: http://bit.ly/1288gv ^DW
twitterapi,@omgfriends we recommend at least securing a dedicated IP address. Most applications don't utilize the resources of a dedicated host. ^DW
twitterapi,@omgfriends shared hosts are a problem if other applications reside on the machine consuming API requests. ^DW
twitterapi,"@sushantanand no, you have to search for individual hashtags. ^DW"
twitterapi,@omgfriends are you on a shared host? ^DW
twitterapi,"@ariflinkman yes, any call to a search API counts against the limit ^DW"
twitterapi,"@tweetvines yes, via the email address associated with the account used to file the application. ^DW"
twitterapi,@quaelin Indeed. The code to loosen the restriction on in_reply_to_status_id validation to include mentions is in the deploy pipeline. ^DW
twitterapi,@paulhenrich there is a hard limit on the Search API. We intentionally withhold the actual value. ^DW
twitterapi,Thanks @vl for our new background. Form and function! ^DW
twitterapi,"@Kerk yes, but these methods are still subject to follow and update limits: http://bit.ly/epN5U ^DW"
twitterapi,@tothbenedek We allow apps with large user bases to register multiple IP addresses. ^DW

twitterapi,@bobsaintclare accidental social coder. I like that. ^DW
twitterapi,@Fractality I will check into this and update the doc if necessary. Thanks. ^DW
twitterapi,@twipstream Can you confirm your whitelisting as per http://bit.ly/1UdYtX ^DW
twitterapi,@warmth We're working on updating our time zone data. Thanks for the heads up. ^MS
twitterapi,@SwaroopH  thanks for the complement! ^DW
twitterapi,@toober screen names with underscores work fine when I just tested via curl ^MS
twitterapi,@Ashik_Jain You can call http://tinyurl.com/cgnplj to validate credentials. ^MS
twitterapi,@tayknight it's working for me. Paul and I are discussing directly to find the source of his issue ^MS
twitterapi,"@tayknight in order for the OAuth signature to match, yes they do. See also: http://bit.ly/PxbKi ^MS"
twitterapi,@mattfreedman good luck with that app! ^DW
twitterapi,@khrabrov we will announce availability to the push solution after the test phase. We are still developing our terms of service. ^DW
twitterapi,"@WzeroMN Twitter is about following interesting discussions not maintaining symmetry, e.g. you follow this account but don't follow back ^DW"
twitterapi,@omgfriends I'm the one that does most of the approvals so your tweet *may* have helped. ^DW
twitterapi,@quaelin I'll bring this up with the core app team to find out why they restrict the in_reply_to_status_id so heavily. ^DW
twitterapi,@omgfriends You can find that in the docs: http://apiwiki.twitter.com/Rate-limiting ^DW
twitterapi,@quaelin I was just informed that you have to start the tweet as an @reply for in_reply_to_status_id to be accepted. ^DW
twitterapi,@evilhackerdude you are correct. Updating the documentation appropriately. ^DW
twitterapi,"@ivey That's my point. I'd rather see people promoting healthy following habits, and creating interesting social graphs. ^DW"
twitterapi,There is more to the API than the ability to easily unfollow those that aren't following you back. Seen too many examples of this today. ^DW
twitterapi,@N This is a known issue. Please see http://bit.ly/mRuvu ^DW
twitterapi,@nischu7 we have no target date. ^DW
twitterapi,@WzeroMN That is not the type of behavior we want to promote. ^DW
twitterapi,"@evilhackerdude No, @replies are now mentions: http://bit.ly/lWluO ^DW"
twitterapi,@vsr I'm actually working on that. Sit tight! ^DW
twitterapi,@quaelin Did you mean in_reply_to_status_id=1630169543? ^DW
twitterapi,@quizoo whitelisting queues are generally emptied every day. We of course don't work as hard on the weekends :) ^DW
twitterapi,@dainbrain regex searches are very expensive to do serve side ^DW
twitterapi,@quaelin Please read the in_reply_to_status_id documentation here http://bit.ly/m5MLo ^DW
twitterapi,@worldclasscoder we do not offer twitter templating. You should create that service! ^DW
twitterapi,"@mgrdcm no, not at this time. ^DW"
twitterapi,@abrahamvegh be sure to share with the mothership! ^DW
twitterapi,@Jaku Fixed that documentation. Thanks for the help! ^DW
twitterapi,@sharding can you give more details? ^DW
twitterapi,@cachondo we can still manually register apps. ^DW
twitterapi,"@sanjay yes it is known, you can see our defects and enhancements list here: http://bit.ly/58lCW ^DW"
twitterapi,@thekarladam we are still discussing that solution; it is not being ignored. Basic Auth still remains our answer for most desktop apps. ^DW
twitterapi,Please send @mzsanford and @bs your heartfelt thanks because OAuth is back! http://bit.ly/18gF5a ^DW
twitterapi,@kyletolle  ^DW == @dougw. We use @cotweet which places signatures (@cotags) on each tweet so you know who is replying.
twitterapi,@dbingham Please see http://status.twitter.com ^DW
twitterapi,Last night's trouble deploy kept the OAuth fix from shipping. We are working on it right now. ^DW
twitterapi,@lucas42 please search the archives. This has been discussed many times. ^DW
twitterapi,@jazzychad there was a data corruption issue which when fixed will correct the DM data problem. ^DW
twitterapi,"A selection of changes deployed today, check out http://bit.ly/api_changelog. There are more on the way for tomorrow. ^MS"
twitterapi,@josiahplatt glad to help! ^DW
twitterapi,@RobTSmith we gave a fix for that. Thanks. ^DW
twitterapi,@big_love I'm taking care of you. ^DW
twitterapi,"@tomaranand absolutely. We'll let everyone know through @twitterapi, the mailing list(s) and the changelog. ^DW"
twitterapi,"@starwarsfanatic It should not require a huge change to consumer apps. For now, we are holding off on details. ^DW"
twitterapi,@19hsmith82 we are aware of image upload problems and we are working on it. ^DW
twitterapi,What's the deal with OAuth http://bit.ly/17nN1T ^DW
twitterapi,@zigdon I reply when it's a one off answer. I mention when I want others to see the information. ^DW
twitterapi,You may notice problems with the image cache: http://bit.ly/DFJj3 ^DW
twitterapi,We whitelist developers and apps. Do either of those apply to you @miketwardos? ^DW
twitterapi,@swhitley there will be minor changes that will likely involve a bit of refactoring over new code generation. ^DW
twitterapi,@swhitley the plan is to have it back up and running within a day. ^DW
twitterapi,OAuth remains down. Details to come when we can discuss. @jae08  ^DW
twitterapi,@rebelprince an iPhone/iPod formatted version is something we are working on: http://bit.ly/Mui6J ^DW
twitterapi,@bgolub I'll look into that when I get a few minutes. Thanks for the recommendation. ^DW

twitterapi,"@cjkm ^DW == @dougw, ^AP == @al3x, ^MS == @mzsanford. We each contribute to this account and want you to know who is replying. ^DW"
twitterapi,"@nick_thompson the definition of ""best"" is up to the developer. Let's have a few takes on ""best"" to play with. ^DW"
twitterapi,"I was thinking about an 'app that returns ""the best"" 5-10 conversations on a trending topic' on my walk to work today. Anyone working on it?"
twitterapi,"oauth/authenticate is currently disabled, @guan, please see http://bit.ly/R7HQ4 ^DW"
twitterapi,@lordofthelake There is no release date for v2 yet defined. ^DW
twitterapi,"@lucyfir deleting does indeed remove it from both sides, but not search. Check out http://bit.ly/Flp2O ^MS"
twitterapi,@jazzychad rumors of search's death have been greatly exaggerated. There was a pause last night but it was fixed. ^MS
twitterapi,@kiranp You can disable apps in your setting. Check out http://twitter.com/account/connections ^MS
twitterapi,@cometbus Social Graph methods having difficulty with large follower lists is a known issue: http://bit.ly/R5tGb ^DW
twitterapi,@guan Sorry about that. I was away for the weekend and am still playing catch-up. Let me see what I can find. ^DW
twitterapi,@uberChick we aren't exclusively OAuth. We still support Basic Auth. We however do ask that able developers consider OAuth in the near-term.
twitterapi,Please help @benreesman. He asked: @twitterapi how long before we can follow hastags? ^DW
twitterapi,@BarryGivens Where are you seeing sinceid vs. since_id? ^DW
twitterapi,@startuptech Sign in with Twitter should be enabled now. We were performing a deploy for a security fix. ^DW

twitterapi,@dennisl What response code are you getting: http://tinyurl.com/crcz44 ^DW
twitterapi,@sarperdag you have to count on the client side. There is no result count returned with the search API. ^DW
twitterapi,@c3k I have filed a ticked against the UX bug. Thanks. ^DW
twitterapi,@c3k Thanks for the report. I filed a ticket with the UX folks to take a look. ^DW
twitterapi,@yongsu have you seen twitpic.com? ^DW
twitterapi,@dpkendal suggested that Twitter schools can use the API to connect with parents. Are there any sites helping to manage this communication?
twitterapi,@mrbellek good one!  ^DW
twitterapi,"@yemkay default focus on ""allow"" is a great suggestion. ^DW"
twitterapi,"RT @dougw: Now that that @oprah has brought the moms, 
@twitterapi devs how we can make their lives easier with @twitter?"
twitterapi,@stanlemon That sounds like a caching bug. Can you add an issue to the code list? ^DW
twitterapi,@Andrew_Taylor all employee passwords are longer that 140 chars so they are difficult to tweet. I'm sure you can understand. ^DW
twitterapi,@birdshot the password issue should now be fixed. Sorry about that. ^MS
twitterapi,Issue where search.twitter.com was asking for an employee password has been fixed ^MS
twitterapi,Lots of folks reporting in that search.twitter.com is asking for an employee password. We're looking into it. ^DW
twitterapi,@birdshot what method are you requesting? ^DW
twitterapi,"@stanlemon Just tested, seems to be working over here. ^AP"
twitterapi,@dacort You know where to send examples :) ^AP
twitterapi,"@c3k Our non-API support staff handles recovering accounts. It's up to them, and depends on their current ticket load. ^AP"
twitterapi,@jonaboff That's our response code for rate limiting. See http://tinyurl.com/5x3czv ^AP
twitterapi,"@dukeleto Not that I've seen. Some sites do their own spam filtering when collecting search results, though. ^AP"
twitterapi,"@c3k We allow people to request inactive accounts. However, we don't proactively reclaim accounts. ^DW"
twitterapi,@briantroy See this thread on Twitter Development Talk: http://bit.ly/nef1 ^AP
twitterapi,@davidmccormack thanks for the report. We'll have a look shortly. ^DW

twitterapi,What does your Twitter client of choice do for you that no other Twitter client does? ^DW
twitterapi,@elehack the desktop use case is one we are still trying to fix. Can developers not store their own tokens/secrets during build ^DW
twitterapi,"@benreesman it does not, we are working on a work around for that ^DW"
twitterapi,@dossy Please use the thread you created in the groups to paste your data. ^DW
twitterapi,"@crisatunity Yes, image upload for application icons is a known issue: http://bit.ly/xRVej ^DW"
twitterapi,@ljharb The Read/Read-Write contract is established and bound at authorization time. ^DW
twitterapi,@dossy yes the XML is complete and well formed. ^DW
twitterapi,@foxroxfrmOx Default images in the public timeline is a known issue http://bit.ly/mRuvu ^DW
twitterapi,@dossy /statuses/followers is working well for me through cURL. What are you doing differently? ^DW
twitterapi,"For those of you reporting lots of 400s, can you confirm you are not being rate limited with a call to account/rate_limit_status? ^DW"
twitterapi,@dossy are you being rate limited? ^DW
twitterapi,"Any pioneers in filtration? See http://bit.ly/1WWVO6 and http://bit.ly/13nlGg. @tweetdeck, @atebits, @loic, etc.?"
twitterapi,"@bryanjswift there is no way currently. This issue was recently opened, so star it up if you want it: http://bit.ly/4Gh5O ^DW"
twitterapi,"Source parameters can no longer be manually registered, as described here http://bit.ly/HhfCb ^DW"
twitterapi,Two API bug fixes launched today. More details at http://bit.ly/api_changelog ^MS
twitterapi,@gesteves You will have to lookup the lat/long coordinates through an outside service. The API does not have that data. ^DW
twitterapi,@auras We have deprecated the ability to request a source parameter link: http://bit.ly/HhfCb ^DW
twitterapi,"@unknowndomain Go to Settings -&gt; Notices and change ""@ Replies"" to ""@ replies to the people I'm following"". Less noise! ^AP"
twitterapi,@cnelsonpub Can you point us to a couple of example statuses with bad encoding? You can expect what the docs specify. ^AP
twitterapi,@auras We're handling that via OAuth now. We'll automatically link up your OAuth apps. ^AP
twitterapi,@kiranp What do you mean by a list of OAuth Client apps? ^DW
twitterapi,@c3k embedded content is often discussed on the API list. Main drawbacks relate to SMS delivered tweets. Check out http://bit.ly/cHEei ^MS
twitterapi,@siovene closest I know is a C++ library at http://bit.ly/14RDLE ^MS
twitterapi,"@dominik I should have worded that better, we deployed no code to fix the issue in question. That comment was  mostly re: changelog ^MS"
twitterapi,@davidmccormack that looks correct to me. What were you expecting. Can you bring it to the boards? ^DW
twitterapi,@sku_ very nice implementation. Can't wait to see the embed version. ^DW
twitterapi,The non-ASCII updates via OAuth should be working again soon. Error found and working on the fix. See http://bit.ly/twapi433 ^MS
twitterapi,@iPhoneDevGuy I'll need some more info. Check out http://bit.ly/twapi454 for the details that help ^MS
twitterapi,@guan String#truncate sure can :) ^MS
twitterapi,@Twaitting if it's just one user it sounds like the follow limit. Check out http://bit.ly/twfollowlimit ^MS
twitterapi,@g1smd PBWiki does some strange things. You can uses dashes too: http://tinyurl.com/bj39zx ^MS

twitterapi,@hsl I recall some talk about that on the API list. Check out http://bit.ly/ZnFeC ^MS

twitterapi,@xsolutions our profile URL has been fixed at last! ^MS
twitterapi,"@destroytoday It's a known issue, check out http://bit.ly/twapi431 ^MS"
twitterapi,@hsl we upgraded the gem as mentioned on the dev group. If your failed posts are non-ascii check out http://bit.ly/twapi433 ^MS
twitterapi,@findchris that follow=true is very confusing. It turns on mobile notifications. Looking forward to renaming in API V2 ^MS
twitterapi,"@CaptSolo Yup, all of the API GET operations are counted in the rate limit ^MS"
twitterapi,RT @dcbriccetti: Post describing my creating a Scala Web Twitter app on Google App Engine: http://tinyurl.com/dmjvgk ^DW

twitterapi,"The API is governed by the same limits follow and update limits discussed here, @attilacsorda: http://bit.ly/epN5U ^DW"
twitterapi,@scriptmunkee Verified that is broken. Can you please file a new issue so we can track the fix? ^DW
twitterapi,@feedtwit solves APP1 http://bit.ly/4tocvc. Easier to use than the spec. ^DW
twitterapi,http://lifeline.atmos.org is a solution to APP2 (http://bit.ly/5nOs) by @atmos and @rustin. Well done! ^DW
