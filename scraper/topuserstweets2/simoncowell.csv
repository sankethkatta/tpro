simoncowell,Goodnight everyone. If you like Xmas movies watch Arthur Christmas. I loved it.
simoncowell,I absolutely love ho hey by the lumineers.
simoncowell,@Lindseyoak I agree. Loved your show this year.
simoncowell,It was tough tonight on the sing off. Both did well. I thought in the studio diamond was better. I hope the exposure vino got will help him
simoncowell,I do think the us and uk finals are going to be close and that makes it more exciting. Especially if a group wins the us show!
simoncowell,On the uk show I do have a favourite but its your vote that determines the winner. Whoever wins will get the backing of Sony.
simoncowell,I want to personally thank everyone who voted for my groups this week. I really do think both have improved. It's much appreciated.
simoncowell,Looking forward to seeing @aliciakeys and @joshkrajcik on the show tonight. #joshisback
simoncowell,I need your help tonight guys. I thought @FifthHarmony and @EmblemThree were amazing. Please vote!!!
simoncowell,Watching mr poppers penguins again. I love this film. I really do want a pet penguin.
simoncowell,@LucyLBax sorry. I meant happy birthday
simoncowell,@LucyLBax happy birthdat
simoncowell,Just realised I am following 666 people. That is a little scary
simoncowell,Both emblem 3 and 5th harmony very good in rehearsals today. I am happy.
simoncowell,@ICONicTayler312 thank you
simoncowell,Who is mr. T?
simoncowell,Thank you for the replies. I was curious because it was mentioned in a few messages.
simoncowell,Who is mr x?
simoncowell,Hello. Thank you for your emblem 3 and fifth harmony song suggestions. You will see what I have chosen for the Pepsi challenge next week.
simoncowell,Good night. Sleep well.
simoncowell,@TogetherXLove I agree
simoncowell,I went to a thanksgiving party and someone told me to listen rather than talk. You have two ears and one mouth. Very good advice
simoncowell,@niamissocool every day
simoncowell,Why I am angry about weirdo gore is a ton of people have got shot this year and people.like weirdo gore encourage this.
simoncowell,I read Martin gore wants to shoot  me. He was is in depeche mode. Do you realise how weird and stupid that makes you. Go and watch the news.
simoncowell,Hi Olly Murs. Congratulations on your number one single today. You are a true star and a great guy. Proof success doesn't change you.
simoncowell,Time for bed. One piece of advice...cut all of the negative people out of your life and suddenly life gets better.
simoncowell,I just realised we only have four more shows left here. It's gone so quick.
simoncowell,This is one of those nights when I have to talk to London from la. that's why at five am I am sending out tweets.
simoncowell,Would love you to suggest some song ideas for emblem 3 and 5th harmony. I have to get them into the finals.
simoncowell,I Watched a film tonight called Arthur Christmas. Loved it. And actually proves Santa Claus is real!
simoncowell,Cher was fantastic on X factor this week. A brat. But adorable.
simoncowell,To everyone voting in the uk tonight. Please vote for who you believe could be a star next year. It's in your hands.
simoncowell,The final in America could be our closest yet. There may be more than two acts in the final. And you never know what could happen.
simoncowell,The final here in America could be our closest yet. There may be more
simoncowell,Re X factor uk. Yes to someone who just guessed it.
simoncowell,I was sad to lose Beatrice. But I felt the pressure on her was too much. But I have a feeling she will have a big future.
simoncowell,Very interesting end coming up for X factor in the uk. I think the final is going to be very interesting! I have my own favourite.
simoncowell,Very sad to hear about larry hagman. He was the best tv baddie and from people who met him all said he was a great guy. He will be missed.
simoncowell,Happy Thanksgiving everyone!
simoncowell,"Thought @emblemthree were amazing,  @LA_Reid is in a bad mood! And Diamond White was sensational."

simoncowell,". @piersmorgan Why are you still being so ridiculously competitive? You should have realised by now it's quality, not quantity."
simoncowell,Thank you for the Thanksgiving invitations. Could I have some menus sent before I decide?
simoncowell,I've just realised it's Thanksgiving this week and I haven't been invited to anyone's house. I feel like a dog without a home
simoncowell,I've just been told I can tweet when its not a show day!
simoncowell,Met with Astro and his father today and @LA_Reid. Everything is much calmer now and the good news is he's back on the show next week
simoncowell,I agree with Astro's message: it's 'time to relax & reflect'
simoncowell,I very nearly changed my mind.
simoncowell,"Thank you America. That was horrendous, but I'm glad for my girls."
simoncowell,How the hell did that happen?
simoncowell,"After the show today, the judges and contestants are going to be at the Grove in LA. Looking forward to meeting you all there!"
simoncowell,@piersmorgan look up the word deluded in your dictionary
simoncowell,I love being on twitter. Thank you for allowing me to beat the other 3 in the popularity poll. Paula looked like she'd sucked on a lemon!
