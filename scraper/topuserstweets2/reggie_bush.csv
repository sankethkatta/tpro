reggie_bush,I'm gonna go with Michael Jordan and if Kobe ends up winning more rings than him then it's really gonna get interesting! But Bill top 5???
reggie_bush,@QBKILLA I agree that it's most likely Jordan! But you gotta admit it's hard to win 11 of anything! Shoot it's hard to score 11 touchdowns!!
reggie_bush,@LarryFitzgerald bruh you know as much as I do it's hard to win one championship? Bill Russel won 11! I'm not saying he the best but.....

reggie_bush,Worst case scenario you get hit up top=concussion. Worst case scenario you get hit down low=knee surgery or possible end of career.
reggie_bush,As an offensive player I have to say I disagree w/ the enforcement of the rule. I'd much rather get hit up top then down low in the knees.
reggie_bush,The illegal hits throughout the NFL have been a huge controversy. What do you guys think about the rules? Fair not fair? Should be changed?
reggie_bush,RT @JoeDaDon: @reggie_bush he's related to Steve Bartman (ha ha ha!)

reggie_bush,And the bigger picture is not just about the current players. But also the retired players who are maybe now broke. What happens to them?
reggie_bush,Every NFL Athlete does not make millions. That's a small percentage of the NFL. The vast majority makes nowhere near that.
reggie_bush,Healthcare is an issue that all people can relate to. And as Football Players it is the back bone of our business and life.
reggie_bush,"And it's not a strike, it's a lockout on the NFL Owners behalf! The players want nothing more than to play, but we have to be protected!"
