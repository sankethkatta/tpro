juniorbachchan,Have a smashing day @TheRajKundra make sure you dont tap out but knock them out this year. Happy birthday my man!

juniorbachchan,@msaigal meet his fans???
juniorbachchan,@msaigal replied to once before that if I do get the opportunity I would love to meet you. How does that make a person who doesnt like to..
juniorbachchan,@msaigal and thats reason enough for you to continuously pass unfair and rude remarks about me?
juniorbachchan,"@msaigal we try and meet and take photographs and sign autographs as much as possible. Unfortunately,i havent managed to meet you."
juniorbachchan,@msaigal ALL our time to the fans. But we need to be professional also. Am sure you have a job. Dont you do the same at ur workplace?
juniorbachchan,"@msaigal Ive said this to you before, hope you understand and respect the fact that we are here to work. We would love to dedicate"
juniorbachchan,@msaigal its very presumptuous of you to pass judgement on me. And that too wrongly! Being rude isnt going to get you anywhere mr. Saigal.
