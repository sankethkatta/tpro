drdrew,@Canadian_Paula Jessica Sierra is doing extremely well. I gave her a one year cake a couple of weeks ago.
drdrew,@tonyhawk Thanks Tony!  Come back on Loveline soon.
drdrew,I will ask Jenn to Tweet. I don't believe she does.
drdrew,Finishing the voice overs for Sober House today. Should connect with Jenn there whose life has really been changed by the project.
drdrew,@tonyhawk Great to see you on Twitter.  Here's a great segment from when you were on Loveline:  http://tinyurl.com/am8x4m
drdrew,@ijustine and @dhlawrencexvii (from Heroes) will be dropping by Loveline tomorrow but probably not on the show... but will be on qik.com.
drdrew,Looking forward to meeting @ijustine and @dhlawrencexvii (from Heroes) tomorrow for some tips on Twitter and social media.
drdrew,Just spoke with Andy Dick who is doing AMAZING.  Climbing in to a tuxedo for the charity event.
drdrew,If you want more information on Hillsides Educational Center: http://tinyurl.com/cw2fdo They are a great organization.
drdrew,Going for a run. Hopefully.  Charity event tonight for Hillside Home for Children
drdrew,Vicki Cristina  is just one of those films that stays with you. I keep thinking about it.  Woody does that to me
drdrew,"Liked Wall E, (didn't love it).  Still haunted by Vicki Cristina Barcelona"
drdrew,OK OK Wall E it is
drdrew,@RockSkull Did you mean to give me this link about Chuck Norris???
drdrew,OK now I'm even more conflicted.  Maltese Falcon was an early and overwhelming favorite but Wall I coming on strong
drdrew,Damn seen all the Mad Men.  So Wall E vs Maltese Falcon vs Kite Runner.
drdrew,@RockSkull ....fracture was simply a probability equation that could not be guaranteed not to happen
drdrew,@RockSkull I had a friend who was an MIT Metallurgist who scared the crap out of me when he insisted that plane fuselage/wing metal....
drdrew,But not so bad in these huge 767's.  Not so many of them flying any more since 9/11
drdrew,"NY to LA, always gets nasty bumpy over the bad weather and the Rockies"
drdrew,The seatbelt sign is not on though it is bumpy. About to check on the movies
drdrew,BTW talked to Jeff Conaway today. Actually he's doing much better. I am once again hopeful.
drdrew,"American Airlines has ""GoGo"" wifi from LA to NY so types like us can stay connected."
drdrew,Don't you just love those sleeps that are actually some how satisfying like a good meal?  I feel bad for those with sleep disturbances.
drdrew,Slept like a rock. Now as promised Twittering from the sky
drdrew,"This day is finally ending. Sleeping soon.  Flying back to LA tomorrow. Will Tweet from 37,000 feet!"
drdrew,The 21st birthday reference was a pasted tweet from kiraplatinum
drdrew,"Everybody head over to check out and follow my friend DJ AM, he is flying again!"
drdrew,"kiraplatinum@Drdrew: Nikki is doing incredible. She and Craig came to my 21st birthday this past weekend, looking even better than ever!"
drdrew,Nikki I hear continues to do very well.  She is back in Texas with her husband and kids.
drdrew,"Loveline in one hour, about to walk down 57th to CBS for broadcast back to West Coast. So far a looks like it will be a 21 hour day."
drdrew,"Translation? ""If everyone would just experience the world through my eyes you would like everything I like"" - Thoughts?"
drdrew,"Anybody else disturbed by Gwyneth Paltrow's : ""You don't really get it, because if you did, you would like it."""
drdrew,His show a breath of fresh air in the world of traditional news
drdrew,"DL Hughley very good, really love that guy. Though I never get to see him that he doesn't take me through his list of medical ailments"
drdrew,Off to see DL
drdrew,"Twitterers have strong opinions!  Purple it is.
  (wore yellow on Today Show earlier anyway so I agree)"
drdrew,Managed to work out before Hughley.  Will catch up on sleep tonight. Purple tie or Yellow?
drdrew,"Dragging through the day. DL Hughley next.  Really like that guy, should be fun."
drdrew,Today Show x2 this AM.  Like 3:30 am Pacific for me.  Pretty tired.
drdrew,Everyone wants to know about Seth. He is still alive but struggle with sobriety.  I worry about him ALOT
drdrew,Tyra did a wonderful job bringing back some of our families from Sex with Mom and Dad. Very inspiring to see them doing so well
drdrew,Really fun time with Fox Red Eye.They read the Twitter activity and asked me what was my favorite Woody Allen film!
drdrew,chicagojane@drdrew The phone # for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-TALK for anyone who might need it
drdrew,"@GregDietz Check out the Book ""Your Inner Fish"""
drdrew,jnjackson@Drdrew watched sex w/ m&d on your recommendation last weekend  it was great.
drdrew,Tomorrow Today Show and DL Hughley
drdrew,"In NYC, doing a Tyra episode and Fox Red Eye.Promoting Sex with Mom and Dad.It's a good show guys, I recommend."
drdrew,We have to ask ourselves is this to be an entitlement or an Insurance?
drdrew,"mattheweide@Drdrew the basic system that Germany has? Everyone gets basic coverage...if you want better, you pay a little more? Simple!"
drdrew,As it is the tail (Insurance Cos) is wagging the dog (the care of the patient) People would not believe how bad it gets
drdrew,What is to be covered and how do we pay for it.I think should  protect us all from catastrophe but maybe not cover every little thing.
drdrew,I am very much in favor of massive change in how we cover health care and a universal system of coverage.Question is :
drdrew,@BradmanTV check out my wife's comments on LAist.  She fairly well articulated my feelings as well
drdrew,Love and Death is my favorite Woody Allen film
drdrew,But liked it. I can not resist his work.Penelope fantastic
drdrew,"Vicky Cristina-Needed Woody on screen.I think he has climbed so far up in his intellect, he has disconnected from the rest of our reality"
drdrew,Alec Baldwin-not an alien.Actually a VERY cool guy.Just had a very interesting conversation with him.Thought of my affection for Steven&Dan
drdrew,"American to Kennedy, now TMZ can meet Alec when we land"
drdrew,About to watch Vicky Christina Barcelona...good?
drdrew,Would u could u on a plane...Alec Baldwin sittng 5ft from me
drdrew,"Weird, twittering at 35,000ft thanks to Am Air & GoGo"
drdrew,Andy and Jenn on Loveline in 20minutes
drdrew,That is Gary's girlfriend Stephanie.  I love that Busey
drdrew,Excited for Andy Dick and Jennifer from Sober House on Loveline tonight.Tomorrow if you are East of Chicago.But even then online tonight
drdrew,Anybody have any thoughts on Juliaroy?She is about to fall victim to my axe.Am I supposed to feel bad for her???
drdrew,Get to work out before going back to work.  Heading to NYC tomorrow to promote Sex with MandD.  Just love that town.
drdrew,drdrewquestion @Drdrew Think I have Penile Mondor's Disease-usually benign and resolves spontaneously. See your doctor to r/o coagulationDO
drdrew,In California health providers are required to give patients opportunity to exert their right to engage in unhealthful activity like smoking
drdrew,"Eat less (decrease fat especially) and move more.  Pretty simple
Eliminate alcohol, cigs and pot."
drdrew,"Fatigue, low sex drive, constant hunger - not worth it"
drdrew,VERY low calorie diets have been known to be associated with longevity.  The people that follow this have all sorts of symptoms - ?worth it?
drdrew,Loveline over.  Lots to do tomorrow.
drdrew,Molly Simms that was her name!
drdrew,@Firstladyoflove you don't know I may have a plan.  I seem pretty connected to Mr Greene
drdrew,@Firstladyoflove He had to go to Sacramento so is going to send you info on  how to send to him
drdrew,"Firstladyoflove Honey, im home! -Yea. Tell the Twitters about the party!"
drdrew,About to begin Loveline.  Left the Firstladyoflove behind at the party.
drdrew,Jackman did a great job on the Oscars. Fun watching it with a bunch of people from that industry.
drdrew,"I was really surprised how much I enjoyed the party.  Sir Elton was there, he has a great charity to support AIDS research/education"
drdrew,"""The Mirror Effect"" is the title of the book. Off to meet Sir Elton...weird"
drdrew,I have written a book about why we are are so celeb obsessed and why something like that would make news - comes out mid March
drdrew,"LTPfromDC @Drdrew ""What do you know about UK celeb Jade Goody who has terminal cervical cancer? Do you think it's related to HPV?"" 90%+are"
drdrew,"cagirl24931 @Drdrew Just an FYI from someone in the biz, it's HIPAA - not HIPPA, Health Insurance Portability Accountability Act.   Thanks!"
drdrew,Out out damn funk.  Going to a crazy Oscar viewing party tonight. Don't know what I am doing at such a thing but should be interesting.
drdrew,You actually can't really even discuss much specific with colleagues without written permission from patient
drdrew,Tough being a physician. Lots of my frustrations cannot be twittered or for that matter shared with anyone  - HIPPA don't ya know.
drdrew,Good review of EMDR http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/emdr.html
drdrew,@tedstryker those productions just wear you down.  So what were you looking at?
drdrew,"""What is ted r. stryker looking at in his room?""  -  I don't really want to know!"
drdrew,Done and done....removed it.  Feeling strangely empowered
drdrew,I think I am going to end my relationship with secrettweet.  Like watching an endless reel of violent accidents.....
drdrew,botherer @Drdrew Re EMDR: http://www.quackwatch.org/0 - I concur with this review but have seen it useful as part of comprehensive treatment
drdrew,Google EMDR - it's a strange therapy and includes characteristic eye movements that allows access to overwhelming trauma
drdrew,Secrettweet is really frightening me.  Every tweet I read needs immediate attention and treatment. No fooling.
drdrew,"By saying ""I used Chantix with success""  I mean I have given it to many patients with great utility.  Helped them stop cigs."
drdrew,Leukoplakia = precancerous lesion of mouth.  Leukorrhea = lymph draining to the outside world.
drdrew,Gavinsdad @Drdrew Don't forget Leukoplakia... not to be confused with Leukorrhea. I always mix those two up
drdrew,To be clear I have NO relationship with Chantix.  I merely used it with great success.
drdrew,"Chewing tobacco will result in hideous deforming tumors of the mouth, tongue, Larynx"
drdrew,Boxer-briefs!
drdrew,Heady stuff for Saturday morning. Can't we go back to talking about Mermaid Cloacae with Rainn Wilson?
drdrew,PTSD is one of the most difficult problems to treat.  Often trauma affects personality structure as well.  Might look in to EMDR
drdrew,I address smoking cessation with every patient.  Cigarettes eventually will kill you - guaranteed.
drdrew,And don't worry about getting addicted to the gum etc.  It won't hurt you even long term.
drdrew,"Nicotine replacement also VERY useful particularly in first 2-3 weeks after stopping but need to use high dose(patches, lozenges and gum)"
drdrew,Ondansetron literature very interesting but I have not had any clinical success as yet with it.
drdrew,Chantix can cause crazy dreams/mood changes.It needs to be monitored VERY carefully but can break addiction to cigarettes which WIll Kill.
drdrew,Chantix is great for smoking cessation.  About 30% of the time patients just don't want to smoke.  Can affect mood but not often and issue.
drdrew,Ibogaine cures nothing. Many of my patients have tried it.  But they end up with mood and personality changes.
drdrew,"@rainnwilson Mermaids must be like farm animals and have a Cloacae
combo vagina and anus.  But Rainn, can you find it?"
drdrew,Doing nothing (for a change).  Hanging with fam.
drdrew,Got it.....
drdrew,"ADAM, I want to wish you well and need you to direct message me your phone number, or call me at home if you get this message!"
drdrew,@Capn_YoAsse Adam Carolla's Show.
drdrew,"I want to wish you well and need you to direct message me your phone number, or call me at home if you get this message!"
drdrew,Signing out.  Lots of hospital in the morning.  Doing some teaching of med students
drdrew,I can't believe we got invited by VH1 to an Oscar Viewing party hosted by Elton John. What the hell will  I be doing there?
drdrew,"So funny ""Octophiloshit""  so saith the firstladyoflove"
drdrew,It was an amazing experience retracing Rodney's step that fateful night.  Unbelievable how forgiving and positive he has been about it
drdrew,nat @Drdrew take what Perez says about Lily with a grain of salt. Dude has a SERIOUS issue with fabricating things about her-Perez thoughts?
drdrew,@Tatiana_DelToro More that I am a fan of this season of American Idol.  Congratulations to you and the other contestants
drdrew,"""perezhilton @Drdrew I call 'em like I see 'em!""  Thank you Perez for the head's up."
drdrew,Thank you all for the Lily Allen spottings. I can only hope this is some sort of mistake.  Still not cool and not happy. I hope she is well.
drdrew,Sober House tonight on VH1 at 10 p.m.
drdrew,Love that Jimmy Fallon twitters himself in spite of being so busy getting his new talk show up and running.  Me off to hospital
drdrew,"Wrapping up. Hopefully Lily Allen is feeling better.  
Loving ""the Lonely Island"" look for that CD.  Love me some Andy Samberg"
drdrew,Check out the interview with Firstladyoflove on LAist.
drdrew,Apparently a physician is being dispatched to her as we speak......
drdrew,and viral illnesses
drdrew,"hrogers @Drdrew ""Are there really 76 million foodborne disease cases in the US annually.""  Sounds about right.  Most very mild diarrheas"
drdrew,So sorry to hear the Lily apparently had food poisoning.  Persistent vomiting is usually common Staph food poisoning.
drdrew,Got Loveline only to find that Lily Allen just cancelled!  That is not cool and I am not happy.
drdrew,I said mindless not Bad tv and cinema.  Just too fatigued to be challenged
drdrew,I am such a nerd.  I have been craving mindless film and television...watching American Idol.
drdrew,Looking forward to interviewing Lily Allen on Loveline.  She's had an interesting year and seems great now.
drdrew,"""TaiSaintBoogie @Drdrew I have to agree: Sex w/ Mom and Dad was ALOT better than I expected. Wish it was around when I was 16...""  Thanks!"
drdrew,Hospitals all day the Lily Allen on Loveline tonight.
drdrew,Goobian @Drdrew 1077theend.com also streams loveline for free.
drdrew,Now it's my turn to be a lightweight.  Loveline is winding down and I will take my drive back to Pasadena.Will be asleep by 12:34 or pissed
drdrew,"djmayhem @Drdrew my itunes has a kroq stream, i believe that stream is available worldwide. you want a link for that?"
drdrew,"keldwud @Drdrew Is LoveLine only syndicated stateside, or does it reach Europe?check out Lovelineshow.com or westwood one for streaming etc"
drdrew,OK I take it back!  Everyone awake was just not showing themselves until I gently nudged
drdrew,twitterers seem like an early to bed crowd.  Loveline is still on and Twitter activity has slowed to a crawl
drdrew,@lilyroseallen lily see you on Loveline tomorrow.  Cheers.
drdrew,BTW watching American Idol with family.  Seacrest did a pretty good job fielding a huge technical gaff
drdrew,"Off to Loveline, no guest tonight.  Lilly Allen later in the week (i think maybe tomorrow) very cool"
drdrew,"@frozenfoxfire Loveline last night was fun.  Had the Poker players Unabomber and the Magician.  Cool guys, good show."
drdrew,Twittering next to the Firstladyoflove.  She watched and approved of Sex with Mom and Dad.  Phew....(it is a good show)
drdrew,"The title is only an attention grabber.  The show is good, explores why kids act out and how communication with parents can help"
drdrew,Had my afternoon cancel so should be able to work out today.  Please catch some of the episodes of Sex with Mom and Dad it is really good.
drdrew,And I had the best time with the Free Radio folks and working with Anna and Lance!
drdrew,Do what again!!!!!!!!!
drdrew,Turns out this Free Radio thing I am doing is a promo for VH1 shows.  Firstladyof love email how to get on DAG's facebook!
drdrew,"Oh, yes the ""Unibomber"" - he's a great guest"
drdrew,Don't know who the guest is tonight on Loveline
drdrew,Filming an episode of that VH1 show Free Radio tomorrow.  I am a serious fan of this show as well and really excited to do it
drdrew,"Probably because Monday is heavy day of seeing patients and little else, so need something unchallenging when I get home"
drdrew,Don't know what it is we like about that show Chuck so much but we watch it every Monday.
drdrew,From inpatients to outpatients now back to inpatients. Did the webcam for MTV
drdrew,@jimmyfallon congratulations on the show.  Can't wait to see it.
drdrew,New season of Sex with Mom and Dad begins today on MTV. Despite the crazy name it is a very good show.  Have to do a pod cast for it today.
drdrew,"Saw Just not that in to you.  Loved the cast, messages clear and accurate and beyond that *yawn*"
drdrew,Apple be very very good to me.  I am an Apple fan and would not want to piss them off
drdrew,Just kidding about the Jailbreaking.  I can' t do it even if I wanted to
drdrew,Going to jailbreak my phone
drdrew,savitsky @drdrew Mindless mall cop  -  Too mindless??
drdrew,BTW triplets are 16 so the G rated films are no more
drdrew,Also I plan to try that Qik.com.  Should I jailbreak my iphone to pull it off? Thanks!
drdrew,"Looking for a mindless film for my family this aftenoon.  Suggestions???
Thinking Shopaholic or Not That In to You"
drdrew,Brunch with family to complete the Valentine's Day Weekend Cycle
drdrew,and http://tinyurl.com/5bpop
drdrew,More funny stuff at http://tinyurl.com/vtj9s
drdrew,"Check out James_gunn's on line shorts ""PG Porn""  -- not what you think it is....."
drdrew,Ok really both over rated!  Slumdog at least opens the American mind to the reality of the human condition of most of the world.  Amen?
drdrew,Watching Benjamin Buttons (second time but first for the Valentine)Saw Slumdog Millionaire earlier.Important film but over rated?  Any Amens
drdrew,"LaLaLives @Drdrew ""as soon as I read where his family had him in the Children of God cult as a child, he had my prayers."""
drdrew,He needs prayers not disdain.
drdrew,That character is completely and dangerously intoxicated.  Regardless of the motivation his life is seriously endangered by what I am seeing
drdrew,"I've thought more about Joaquin Phoenix and although he is making mockumentary and playing a ""character""...."
drdrew,"@Dmoney08 nothing, my wife is a Bruin."
drdrew,We have been celebrating since yesterday and having a great valentine's.  I wish everyone the same. HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY!
drdrew,@zachorly true but some days much more so that others.
drdrew,@mattchew03 Andy is doing amazing.  Wearing his SCRAM alcohol monitor.
drdrew,"@RickMacMerc It's becoming a habit... an addiction, if you will."
drdrew,Very challenging day with patients.  Emotionally spent but looking forward to Valentine's with family
drdrew,@mlaramd for sure.  Rash is the most common side effect.  It can go bad in to Stevens Johnson.  Can be a great med
drdrew,@stephanie_fjeld We have a friend who is a restauranteur and he ordered tons of appetizers couldn't eat much after that - but manicotti good
drdrew,@flintironstag thank you.  I hope you like it.
drdrew,First Valentine's Dinner in 30 min
drdrew,"@sumyunguy ""video no longer available"""
drdrew,@nathaniaapple Better ask her.  I remain at her service.  I know dinner tonight with friends and tomorrow with kids.
drdrew,@Firstladyoflove Happy Valentine's Day!
drdrew,@DaveMora now wait a minute......
drdrew,To hospital....
drdrew,"@sl0wburn that is bizarre.  This guy seems to have him down.  I will contact Rainn to give a heads up, suggest you do the same."
drdrew,@frozenfoxfire risks of rapid twittering.. spelling and grammar errors
drdrew,@Lindajones2520 I have met him several times.... Dave Matthews
drdrew,btw I will encourage Shelly and Bob to twitter
drdrew,"Off to see patient, then hang with kids (day off for them) then dinner with firstladyoflove,,,lol"
drdrew,@Lindajones2520 done and done
drdrew,"@sl0wburn impossible, that has to be him"
drdrew,@Lindajones2520 he is a great guy I will Follow immediately
drdrew,@elinertv Very funny!  Cyrano de Twitterac.
drdrew,Twittering that is
drdrew,Follow Greg Grundberg or Rainn if you want to know how this is supposed to work.  They are the ones speaking
drdrew,But she promises not to talk.  She is at Firstladyoflove
drdrew,Why have a twitter if you're not going to participate.  Sort of off putting.  But I must confess.  Sometimes my wife drops in as me!
drdrew,"Had to remove Anderson Cooper from my ""following"" list.  It just isnt' from him!  I am not interested in hearing from his staff."
drdrew,yes indeed Rainn not Rain.
drdrew,I wish I had the Twitter talents of Rain Wilson!
drdrew,"@DavesTape Let's say rather it's ""their"" time to be adopted in to stable families with available parents"
drdrew,@brandon_wirtz We raised triplets and we will be the first to tell you that it is exceedingly dangerous and overwhelming.  Eight-unthinkable
drdrew,@brandon_wirtz That is NOT eight kids at once.  How do you transport 8 infants?  How do they even get to the Pediatrician?
drdrew,@greggrunberg you know as a Dad that it will be literally impossible to parent that many kids adequately
drdrew,@greggrunberg How was the Bar Mitzvah?
drdrew,@greggrunberg At least she has the resources to handle it.
drdrew,@greggrunberg Oh yes.  You are on to something.  Separated at birth?
drdrew,@Firstladyoflove WOW!
drdrew,48 people in the plane crash:-(
drdrew,@Firstladyoflove she told me. Pretty exciting
drdrew,"Horrible, another plane accident tonight in Buffalo NY"
drdrew,David Carradine on Loveline at 10p Pacific
drdrew,@drdrewinspired congratulations
drdrew,@perezhilton direct message me with a number where we can reach you after 10p
drdrew,@perezhilton Come up to Loveline and let's discuss.
drdrew,I fear an inside joke gone bad.
drdrew,I am keeping an open mind about the mockumentary.  But he has several physcial signs that really can't be faked.
drdrew,Make no mistake Joaquin Phoenix is not a hoax.  This man is seriously ill and his life is in danger.  Stand by for trouble.
drdrew,@malinski Sirius filing chapter 11
drdrew,@Firstladyoflove what?
drdrew,This was something reported to me by a financial analyst
drdrew,@leahjones I will have to see it.
drdrew,@Firstladyoflove I have no idea.  For now probably nothing.  I suspect mostly there is just a restructuring of their financial arrangement.
drdrew,@Firstladyoflove It did work. I don't know how the customers are going to be affected.  Stand by (but don't buy any more satelite radios)
drdrew,Sirius radio filed for Chapter 11 today
drdrew,@AblativMeatshld we will found out tonight.  I hear she is doing great
drdrew,Loveline with Mary Cary tonight from Sober House.
drdrew,@jacobsrussell that is more likely Benzodiazepines
drdrew,@frozenfoxfire often very difficult to tell with opiates
drdrew,I think at Lovelineshow.com
drdrew,"@Firstladyoflove I may have to Tazer you, sedation not quick enough"
drdrew,Please listen to listeners interviewing Jason from Friday 13th on Loveline
drdrew,@yoitsing thanks
drdrew,@AblativMeatshld cannot Judge especially about employees of a Psych hospital like myself
drdrew,@Firstladyoflove How Dare You!
drdrew,@DanOlympia me too. One day we will resurrect it or something like it
drdrew,@ihasatardis what did he say?
drdrew,@whywouldistop You are too kind
drdrew,Dinner with family then Loveline with the Jason and the cast of Friday the Thirteenth
drdrew,@buckhollywood It was hard to deny.  Did you see all the other folks who  responded with the same observation?
drdrew,Off to Loveline with Steve O
drdrew,She is the expert that is....
drdrew,If an addict is not lying their diagnosis is in question.  OMG Firstladyoflove on a rampage about multiples...take in from an expert!
drdrew,@meltinghalo Addicts lie about everything until they have been sustained in sobriety
drdrew,@JustWaitAMinute of course.  That is the way it always goes down.  Cravings in fact are good thing.  Reminds people their disease is active
drdrew,@Jenkman_91 I am still assessing
drdrew,@JustWaitAMinute the endorphin release can get a little addictive
drdrew,Now watching jeopardy then off to Loveline - after answering some emails and checking in with the hospitals
drdrew,@GlennRubenstein process that was derailed by the using.  And repairing the deficiencies of affect regulation that lead to initation of use

drdrew,@jonathanchard Drew for now.  Ashamed to say... watching TMZ with my wife
drdrew,"@GlennRubenstein Even then, though not really sober.  A very smart guy."
drdrew,"@SpazMonkey1 Motivation is unimportant this is simply ""it's over"""
drdrew,@iJuli A little bit of a stretch but certainly can have a addictive quality but probably more accurately a compulsion
drdrew,@Truwinner Correct.....
drdrew,"@GlennRubenstein No Fletcher.  Just a sober Steve - O.  He is doing so well, check it out."
drdrew,No Stryker.
drdrew,Steve O joins us on Loveline.  Stryker held prisoner at Charm School.
drdrew,@tedstryker Stay sane in there.  Steve O is joining me tonight on Loveline.  He was just announced as being in Dancing with the Stars
drdrew,Heading out.
drdrew,"@rainnwilson OMG it was.  I laughed, I cried, I shi-"
drdrew,@redwoodred I am for sure now NEVER going to Nova Scotia.  They just wasted 10 minutes of my life with that Pomegranate!
drdrew,@papagunit Thanks for the referral
drdrew,@cwightrun Thank you
drdrew,Signing off Loveline.  See you tomorrow (though maybe too busy to Twitter)
drdrew,Now I'm confused.  Just the latest way to communicate....
drdrew,@Johnwirwin What? Twitter?
drdrew,@Firstladyoflove and you got a contact high.....
drdrew,@meontwitter got it
drdrew,@drdrewfan just this weekend.  Trying to figure out if it is worthwhile or not.  What do you think?
drdrew,@meontwitter btw when is Josh coming back.  I nearly fell out of my car when I heard DFGuy with a French accent.
drdrew,"@meontwitter got it.  You mean ""turn off his Mic Anderson"""
drdrew,@meontwitter ???please explain?
drdrew,"@ciwanski1 thank you, cheers"
drdrew,@markgeragos the question is what were you doing that was of interest to them!?
drdrew,@pepnjen That is a much more difficult distinction and is not purely a medical one.  Cultural and epistemological considerations intrude
drdrew,@amandajl84 just answering peoples' questions....
drdrew,Mrs Dr D is at Firstladyoflove
drdrew,Off to Loveline.  I will try to monitor Twitter while on the air.
drdrew,I think Lily Allen is on Loveline this week
drdrew,@petercoffin Steve Adler
drdrew,@petercoffin I am 100% with you.  I think they are just goofing around
drdrew,@LeoLaporte I blame the business school culture of entitlement
drdrew,Al Green looks great!
drdrew,Substance abuse does not equal addiction
drdrew,@areyouscreening what's that?
drdrew,@dharma_lemon a long story. Basically an accident but a wonderful window into the workings of the human mind.
drdrew,Bob does not have Twitter. Steven is really doing pretty well right now.  Andy is doing amazing.
drdrew,@matineeidyll a year is EXCELLENT.  Many people never get that chance
drdrew,@wwonka666 Nope. Gotta have the genetic potential for addiction otherwise you are just flirting with the immediate toxic potential of a drug
drdrew,@wwonka666 but a guy with a DUI and now serious career consequences is suspect
drdrew,@jeffkern agreed
