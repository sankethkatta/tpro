joey7barton,"@piersmorgan can't blame him for wanting to win trophies, surely Piersy? #TallyHo"
joey7barton,@OllieHoltMirror aptly named stadium for a meaningless friendly. #wankdorf
joey7barton,Carrick/Lampard great players but will be about 40 by the time the next world cup comes round. What is the point? Shambles
joey7barton,Someone with a plan long term. Some to build something. Someone with some accountability. It's too haphazard at the minute.
joey7barton,I would love the national football to have a plan. It's literally a match to match approach. Bring in a Dave Brailsford type person.
joey7barton,Build towards Brazil. Might have to take a step backwards in the short term to go forwards long term. Don't get Carrick inclusion at all...
joey7barton,Trust me I'm not bitter. I would just love to see England take some positive post major championship flop action. Play the kids FFS...
joey7barton,@OllieHoltMirror your correct on that. What is the point of tho game a week before the league starts?
joey7barton,Don't get the Carrick inclusion? Good player but why call him up now and not for the Euro's? Makes no sense #devolution No wonder were sh*te
joey7barton,Good to see the Emanuele Pesoli has unchained himself and is safe and well after his hunger strike outside Italian FA. An extreme protest

joey7barton,Debating whether to watch England or Celeb Big Brother? It's a tough choice based on how much Eng bore me. What is the point of this game?
joey7barton,@eddychemical didn't even realise they were playing until I saw your tweet. Can't wait...
joey7barton,Car crash TV no doubt. Lots of fun to tweeted about by everyone else. Is there any actual 'celeb-retits' in it this year?
joey7barton,I actually put Carroll in but he'd need at least 100k cash to waste whilst he's in there. #3inbigbro
joey7barton,Which 3 would you love to see in there? #3inbigbro
joey7barton,Top 3 people I'd like to see in 'celebrity big brother' 1. Kenny 'f*cking' Powers 2. H from Steps and 3. Michael Carroll(lotto lout)

joey7barton,@robshepherd5 easily. I reckon Messi could be as good on time...
joey7barton,@henrywinter Pele never left his homeland. He played in an awesome team in every World Cup.
joey7barton,@henrywinter think Eusebio/Di Stefano and Brett Angell were better than him

joey7barton,"@piersmorgan is she bollocks. Her dad got in by default, after centuries of rape and pillage of this country by her ancestors."
joey7barton,@jonto74 what! We keep us British not them. There not even Brits. More German than English the old Windsor firm
joey7barton,@lufcforeverjay nah not having any of that. Maybe a little bit of it but not all. Makes u think mind
joey7barton,Read the blog Nicebutdim I'm not totally against Lizzy but she's not a higher being than any of us. That wave annoys as well Its halfhearted
joey7barton,"@piersmorgan but u might not want to name check the queen. 'Your highness' do me a favour, she is queen by default. No higher than any of us"
joey7barton,@piersmorgan singing the national anthem is entirely subjective. You may not like the queen or want to save her but play for your country!
joey7barton,@piersmorgan what happens if you are English by birth but Irish in blood? Do you forget good old fashioned English oppression for centuries?
joey7barton,@piersmorgan agreed YOUR COUNTRY! What happens if you love your country but not the monarchy or what it stands for?
