mcuban,. @alanwarms @Mobtivate @CNBC 40k in taxes for every additional million in profits. You can do a lot with 960k. At least i can.
mcuban,. @alanwarms @CNBC hopefully you looked at the address on your drivers license before you started your business :)
mcuban,"@alanwarms @Mobtivate  @CNBC u do realize that taxes are applied to PROFITS? If u make 300k , +4pct of 50k = 2k. who does that stop ?"
mcuban,@alanwarms @VarcusMiscidi @CNBC and they dont let the marginal tax increase of 4pct  on their PROFITS get in the way of that.
mcuban,@alanwarms  @CNBC Doesnt because marginal tax rate increase of 4pct dont impact hiring unless there are structural problems with the biz
mcuban,"@alanwarms @Mobtivate @CNBC that is a function of business operations , not marginal tax rates. How can you not hire if you are competing ?"
mcuban,@alanwarms @CNBC i would be curious as to which companies you know will be denied access to capital b/c their marg tax rate increased

mcuban,"Obviously APPL didnt invent Patent Infringement Suits, but they are certainly doing what APPL does and trying to perfect it"
mcuban,@Der_elf_1 You do realize that is not the same as licensing ? And u do realize that xerox didnt own all of the IP and Apple copied it anyway
mcuban,@bynkii Would the internet be where it is today if you tech companies were as litigious then as they are now ?
mcuban,@bynkii Why were the screwed ? In tech u keep moving the ball forward and those who copy you are by definition behind.
mcuban,@document @PayntDries Did you see the part about APPL licensing the IP or the IP they saw that Xerox didnt own? Neither did I.
mcuban,"@mintonnews @trojankitten nah, they bought ""access"" Xerox didnt even own all the IP that Jobs got a look at."
mcuban,@bynkii I wish i could. Im trying . Patent litigation is the biggest risk EVERY tech company and most non tech companies face today.
mcuban,. @bynkii No one said they were nice. culture was different. U couldnt patent sw. You tell me why IBM didnt have more patents and sue more ?
mcuban,@bynkii @mcuban i meant the kvetching on twitter. I dont give a crap about how much you have or dont have.
mcuban,"@jckobz And there were computers before the Apple. Point is that IBM was the most valuable company then, like APPL is today"

mcuban,"@ncaole Ive said it before, its a hedge against all the patent stupidity that is going on."
mcuban,@bynkii clean room. Reverse engineering. Fond memories. What would Apple do to Franklin and Vtech (?) today ?
mcuban,@bynkii obviously you can't :)
mcuban,.@scarynetworkguy @bynkii  because IBM had the 5100 &amp; enough lawyers to patent everything under the sun and sue. Kind of like apple today
mcuban,@bynkii what do you think i got wrong ? Im curious
mcuban,". @Kraven9 No. it will force Samsung and other to buy more patents, hire better lawyers and sue more often as a pre-emptive strike"
mcuban,@bynkii @mcuban shit i was an apple and IBM reseller back then. I was there. u could argue that in tech IBM in 1981 = Apple today.

mcuban,"Im thinking to myself, there is no way @kevinolearytv would really offer $1mm #sharktank"

mcuban,"Im thinking, this is not going to look good on TV ...finger in the nose #sharktank"
mcuban,at this point im visioning all the videos of people wearing facemasks  every time there is viral breakout somewhere in the world #sharktank
mcuban,Note...having orders and the contract is always a huge selling point. Money plays #sharktank
mcuban,Where else can a $5mm company get sold in about 4 minutes ?#sharktank
mcuban,The first thing we hear from him is that his comp is worth $5mm. Before his pitch. Thats a big number #SHARKTANK
mcuban,How i wish Bruno and Len from #DWTS had an idea and came into the #sharktank  #paybackbaby !! :)
