johnlegend,@CoryBooker well said. I just think you have to watch the false equivalency. All negative campaigning is not bad or irrelevant.
johnlegend,@MattStern he's made very specific claims about the jobs he created but his math is very fuzzy. And thats because job creation wasn't goal
johnlegend,@MattStern I'm not arguing against Bain. I'm just saying his experience there is not one that was necessarily focused on job creation.

johnlegend,@ComfyPaws @corybooker if Romney were honest about Bain he'd just admit it wasn't his mandate to create jobs. It was to make money

johnlegend,@chrissyteigen @are_youin Vegas is titanium
johnlegend,@DaveThomasStyle beautiful!!!
johnlegend,@JayRichieRich I quit after that one. It's been an interesting conversation. I still respectfully disagree with you
johnlegend,@JayRichieRich you can't seriously use the music business as your example of why kids don't need to graduate hs/college
johnlegend,@JayRichieRich how could you support that statement with all the evidence to the contrary?
johnlegend,@JayRichieRich that is not a true statement. If they don't graduate high school/college their life prospects are significantly changed
johnlegend,@JayRichieRich my point remains that students will ultimately bear the consequences of the system. Their lives /livelihoods are on the line
johnlegend,@JayRichieRich you seem to have a lot of faith in teachers but none in principals. Then you blame students for any failures.
johnlegend,"@JayRichieRich this is going in circles.  If you want to just let teachers teach for life regardless of effectiveness, just say it"
johnlegend,"@JayRichieRich so, if you don't buy test scores as the sole measure, then you have to introduce subjectivity. Which means empower principals"
johnlegend,@JayRichieRich I have no doubt that it's difficult. All the more reason to make sure we have the best teaching corps.  And to pay well!
johnlegend,@JayRichieRich it doesn't have to be completely uniform and top-down to be valid. Only way to do that is to make it strictly test scores
johnlegend,"@JayRichieRich if you assume there's no way to differentiate between good and bad teachers, this is a useless conversation."
johnlegend,@JayRichieRich because teacher quality has such a significantimpact on the nation's future.
johnlegend,"@JayRichieRich not if you hire smart, accountable principals. Why assume principals will be so irresponsible and incompetent?"
johnlegend,@DRondeau66 we've had private sector job growth for like 30+ straight months. reduction in govt spending has slowed GDP growth. Indisputable
johnlegend,@DRondeau66 that's why the economy tanked?  Because everyone worked for the govt?  Interesting reading of economic history.
johnlegend,@theHitmarker @chrissyteigen chrissy already tweeted about the first lady last night. :)
johnlegend,"@JayRichieRich tenure makes it prohibitively costly and drawn out. So it almost NEVER happens. Until recent changes in some states, that is"
johnlegend,Great to see First Lady @MichelleObama at our performance last night. She and the President kickoff the campaign in my home state Ohio today
johnlegend,@JayRichieRich well we need accountability throughout the system and we cant afford a system where adults keep their jobs no matter what
johnlegend,@DRondeau66 I am too!
johnlegend,@JayRichieRich why can any other manager do this but not a principal?  this means we have to hire wise principals but they need authority
johnlegend,@DRondeau66 And let's agree that saying a gov job isnt a real job is a repub talking point not based in reality and demeans vital workers.
johnlegend,"@JayRichieRich instead of a strict formula, let principals hire, fire, train, promote and develop staff like any other org's leader can"
johnlegend,@DRondeau66 of course. And they go hand in hand. Our private sector needs our public infrastructure and education system to be strong too.
johnlegend,@DRondeau66 government spending absolutely can stimulate growth. And lack thereof (see european austerity right now) can stifle growth.
johnlegend,@JayRichieRich I'm saying those students will ultimately be held accountable by LIFE and consequences if they don't work hadd
johnlegend,"@DRondeau66 ummm, I'll call b.s. on that nonsensical statement. Ask the teachers, firefighters and policemen in your city if they have a job"
johnlegend,A big reason why job growth isn't higher -NYTimes: Government Getting Smaller in the U.S. http://t.co/6JC29NF4
johnlegend,@JayRichieRich and this lack of accountability for teachers is still the norm in many districts and states.
johnlegend,"@JayRichieRich until very recently, teachers had absolutely no tie between their effectiveness and their pay and promotions, etc."
johnlegend,"@JayRichieRich students already have a built in accountability. If they don't learn, they don't succeed in life"
johnlegend,@JayRichieRich students' lives are much more directly affected by theirs and their teachers' performance than teachers are.

johnlegend,@kellyzant :-) It might be time to join a party that actually encourages democracy!
johnlegend,@kellyzant Republicans are intent on suppressing student votes only because those students vote overwhelmingly Democratic. No other reason
johnlegend,"College students, make sure you know the new voter eligibility rules in your home state AND the state where you go to school."
johnlegend,"So when someone says they're fighting fraud, they're usually just trying to suppress likely Democratic voters (young, poor, etc)"
johnlegend,Voter fraud is a fictional problem. Ineligible voters simply don't go through the effort to cheat to vote. They don't want it that bad

johnlegend,"And some random singing group put in there that I was once a member.  Good way to get publicity, I guess, but false.  Wikipedia."
johnlegend,I went through a month of interviews where people kept asking me about growing up in pittsburgh.  And I kept wondering why.  Wikipedia.

johnlegend,another reason not to bootleg the album.  i print my song lyrics in the artwork.
johnlegend,making me sound like I write like a dumbass.  haha

johnlegend,Heading Augusta to see the Masters. Never been to a real golf tournament before.
johnlegend,Sorry my tweets keep repeating themselves.  Twitter is fucking with me.  Is Trump part owner??? haha.
johnlegend,I think Trump knows what he's saying is full of shit but also wants to play to racism and xenophobia.  That's what makes it shameful.
johnlegend,"And, given that, one must ask why the question is repeatedly asked to THIS particular president when he's already provided the answer."
johnlegend,So anyone that says he hasn't shown his birth certificate is simply LYING or willfully ignoring the facts or is too lazy to research.
johnlegend,"Regarding my Trump comments... first of all, Obama's campaign has never refused to show his official birth certificate: http://bit.ly/1gDsRq"

johnlegend,@natesmithdrums agreed
johnlegend,@natesmithdrums but the unions also have to value teachers by not implying that they're interchangeable. Teacher quality is critical
johnlegend,@natesmithdrums and I agree that teachers are doing God's work and should be paid well and appreciated and not demonized.
johnlegend,@natesmithdrums I'm not making a young vs old argument. I'm saying the most important factor is effectiveness
johnlegend,@natesmithdrums the solution is excellent teaching and engaged parenting. Both are important
johnlegend,@brooklynsistah do you want your kids taught by the best teachers (regardless of age) or simply the oldest?  I think we know the answer.
johnlegend,@brooklynsistah last in first out means a highly effective younger teacher will be laid off b4 an ineffective older one. Bad for students
johnlegend,@brooklynsistah it is very expensive and takes years to fire an incompetent tenured teacher. That hurts kids. No question about it
johnlegend,@brooklynsistah that's different from saying unions can't collectively bargain.  we just need to change work rules that hurt students

johnlegend,Clearly the deficits didn't matter to certain people when they were fighting to give millionaires a tax cut.  #IDIDNTNEEDATAXCUT!
johnlegend,You can't hold teachers to high standards if you don't treat their profession w/ the respect/compensation it deserves
johnlegend,You can't just cost-cut your way to prosperity. You have to invest to grow.  And education is the most important investment
johnlegend,@nycmemphme so we've figured out that we basically agree.
johnlegend,Our priorities are so backwards right now.
johnlegend,These states should be figuring out how to make teaching MORE attractive to talented young people instead of how to cut teacher pay/benefits
johnlegend,@nycmemphme Do you agree that some of your colleagues may not measure up to this evaluation and they shouldn't be retained?
johnlegend,@nycmemphme That kind of system could be implemented now.  So we agree that it should happen and personnel decisions be made based on it?
johnlegend,@nycmemphme I agree with looking @ all those factors.  Just note that some of those are subjective/based on opinion.  Which is fine w/ me.
johnlegend,"@nycmemphme I agree that standardized tests aren't the only measurement.  I was asking you to explain your objective, accurate evaluation."
johnlegend,"@nycmemphme When you say objective, accurate measurements, do you mean 100% use of standardized tests or some other %?"
johnlegend,"@nycmemphme We should all be on the same side, which is making sure kids get the best education and best teachers available."
johnlegend,"@nycmemphme That's an impossible standard meant to hold up a failing regime.  Evaluations will never be perfect, but can be useful."
johnlegend,"@nycmemphme I'm against any education layoffs rt now, but if we have to lay someone off, performance should be the main criteria, not age."
johnlegend,"@nycmemphme No, I'm saying if they are excellent, don't fire them simply because they're younger.  That doesn't mean all young are xclent."

johnlegend,"New joint w/ @rickyrozay, jay-z and yours truly called ""free mason"". Find it and download it. Fire!"
johnlegend,@rolandsmartin I'm in!
johnlegend,@profgesser agreed.
johnlegend,@rolandsmartin alright man.  speak soon.  be well...
johnlegend,"@rolandsmartin So no one is truly ""free"" from constraints and expectations (i.e. their own boss) unless they check out of society."
johnlegend,@rolandsmartin Every employee/private contractor/entrepreneur/service provider is paid to serve the desires of their boss/client/customer.
johnlegend,"@rolandsmartin perhaps it was effective, because you provoked a good conversation between us!"
johnlegend,"@rolandsmartin but you use the word ""slavery"" intentionally to conjure up dramatic, painful imagery in order to make a point."
johnlegend,@rolandsmartin but comparing modern athletes in 2010 to slaves is a huge stretch that downplays what real slaves endured.
johnlegend,"@rolandsmartin i'll read the book asap. clearly, the history of the treatment of black athletes/entertainers has been awful at times."
johnlegend,"@rolandsmartin is every employee a ""slave"" under your definition?  i have a bunch of employees.  am i their ""master""?"
johnlegend,@rolandsmartin slaves were/are forced to work under the threat of bodily harm with NO compensation.  how is that comparable?
johnlegend,"@rolandsmartin not owning your master recordings is not ideal, but it is certainly not slavery."
johnlegend,"@rolandsmartin i'm signed to a 5-album record deal, but i entered into the deal freely and have been well compensated.  that's not slavery."
johnlegend,"@rolandsmartin but the word ""slavery"" loses value if a player/entertainer making millions is compared so easily to slaves."
johnlegend,@rolandsmartin let's not forget what REAL slaves went through. Comparing them to multimillionaires is a bit much. #nocomparison
johnlegend,RT @chrissyteigen: i feel bad for cleveland but they will always have the drew carey show and the uhhhh cleveland show
johnlegend,@rolandsmartin absolutely. No offense taken!  Much respect.
johnlegend,"The album w/ the Roots is called ""Wake Up!"".  Some very soulful music.  I think y'all will dig it. @questlove is a genius."
johnlegend,"@Samsonite75 Allen, Pierce & Garnett will be seen as a trio.  Just as LBJ, Wade & Bosh will.  Magic, MJ and Larry were clear #1s. different."
johnlegend,"Anyway, while I have your attention, my album w/ the Roots is coming out Sept 21!"
johnlegend,"@Only4RM I am with my first label, but I still maintain that my label is not part of my ""identity"" nearly as much as a team is for a player"
johnlegend,@rolandsmartin So fan perception is a part of the decision.  You can't take the fans out of the equation.
johnlegend,"@rolandsmartin he'll actually make more salary in Cleveland, I believe.  But championships would add to his myth and fan/press recognition."
johnlegend,"@rolandsmartin but the choice is motivated by the prestige and legacy of winning a championship, which impacts how the fans will view him"
johnlegend,"Selfishly speaking, living in NYC for 10yrs, it would be fun to be able see LBJ at MSG all the time.  But I'd feel bad for cleveland."
johnlegend,"@egrdigital i'm not from cleveland, nor am i a cavs fan.  but i grew up in western ohio and i do feel bad for cleveland if they lose LBJ"
johnlegend,@rolandsmartin Very few of my fans know or care who distributes my albums.  But fans care which team a player plays for.
johnlegend,"@rolandsmartin I see your point. I don't think changing record labels and changing b'ball teams are exactly comparable, but i see your point"
johnlegend,"@p2styles For someone who came into all this as a teenager, he's carried himself very well.That's a lot of pressure and hype for a young man"
johnlegend,"Either way, I wish him the best.  He's a phenomenal athlete and seems to carry himself with maturity and dignity beyond his years."
johnlegend,"...rather than joining a dream team mid-career.  But, I guess a championship is a championship and you take it how you can get it."
johnlegend,"Call me old-fashioned, but I'm more impressed by a player who gets drafted or starts young with a team and helps them develop into a champ"

johnlegend,"And to the rest of y'all, I love you and thanks for the support. Now back to our regularly scheduled programming...."
johnlegend,Sorry y'all. Couldn't believe my hairline was a trending topic. Get a life!
johnlegend,"And to the haters, I'm still smarter, more talented, more successful and better looking than u. So fall back."
