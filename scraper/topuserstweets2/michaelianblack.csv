michaelianblack,@TVNewsandNotes @McCainBlogette We yell more.
michaelianblack,@TVNewsandNotes you too
michaelianblack,"@TVNewsandNotes No he didn't. He didn't imply anything of the sort, didn't mention race. Had specific policy reasons."
michaelianblack,@TVNewsandNotes What are you basing that on? There's nothing to suggest blacks would support a black conservative.
michaelianblack,@TVNewsandNotes Again; Powell is an American patriot/hero. To say he supports Obama primarily b/c of race demeans him.
michaelianblack,@TVNewsandNotes Would it be 94-0 if the candidate were a republican?
michaelianblack,"@TVNewsandNotes I didn't hear Chris Matthews say that, but if he did I agree with you."
michaelianblack,@TVNewsandNotes It was respondents to the survey who were asked why African-Americans voted for Obama.
michaelianblack,@TVNewsandNotes show a near consensus that this group did so because of Obama's race (65%) rather than his being the better candidate (35%)
michaelianblack,"@TVNewsandNotes Respondents who were asked why ""African Americans"" voted for Obama..."
michaelianblack,@TVNewsandNotes You read the article wrong. It wasn't African-Americans who said this...
michaelianblack,"@TVNewsandNotes Sununu ""applauded"" Powell? That was the most condescending thing he said. Can a Republican support a Dem? Or vice versa?"
michaelianblack,"@TVNewsandNotes Powell became disillusioned with the neocons during the W admin, and said as much then, the same neocons advising Romney."
michaelianblack,@TVNewsandNotes That's not Powell said; he explicity explained why he supports Obama and does not support Romney - policy differences.
michaelianblack,@TVNewsandNotes ...puts race above country - which is offensive.
michaelianblack,@TVNewsandNotes For Sununu to suggest that Powell supports Obama primarily because of race means that Sununu believes Powell puts race...
michaelianblack,@TVNewsandNotes There's a huge difference between race being a factor and race being THE factor. Powell was Sec. of State...
michaelianblack,"@TVNewsandNotes Because he inferred that Powell supports Obama PRIMARILY because of race, which is offensive."
michaelianblack,@TVNewsandNotes Of course race matters.
michaelianblack,@TVNewsandNotes He might have 5%.
michaelianblack,"@TVNewsandNotes Yes, he was running for president."

michaelianblack,@TVNewsandNotes I agree he believes government can be an instrument to promote economic and social justice.
michaelianblack,"@TVNewsandNotes Because I read that and think, ""Yeah, there is economic and social injustice"" and we can use policy to correct that."
michaelianblack,"@TVNewsandNotes So when you read that, what policies do you think he is supporting? Is there a redistributive policy he's supported?"
michaelianblack,@TVNewsandNotes Redistribution is an action. Our entire tax system is redistributionist. That's what a progressive tax system does.
michaelianblack,Today marks the first anniversary of my decision to mark this day as an anniversary exactly one year ago today.
michaelianblack,"@TVNewsandNotes No. Fraud is an action. Entitlement is a mentality. Victimhood is a mentality. Why not use the word ""fraud?"" Or ""abuse""?"
michaelianblack,"@TVNewsandNotes But he defined ""abusers"" as 47% of the country. He's a numbers guy; he doesn't confuse 47% w/, say, 15%."
michaelianblack,"@TVNewsandNotes Besides, nobody is FOR fraud. Again, he wasn't even talking about fraud. He was talking about people who don't pay fed taxes"
michaelianblack,"@TVNewsandNotes Of course there is fraud at the bottom end, but in terms of $, how does that fraud compare to fraud at the top? Negligible."
michaelianblack,"@TVNewsandNotes The statement was deliberative. It wasn't ""inelegantly stated."" It wasn't anything other than smug, pandering dribble."
michaelianblack,@TVNewsandNotes You want to find redemption in what you believe his intended meaning was instead of just taking him at his word.
michaelianblack,@TVNewsandNotes I agree. But the underlying message is that he seems to think 47% of the country are abusing the system. That's what he said
michaelianblack,"@TVNewsandNotes The point is how disdainful he is of half the country, and how myopic he is about his own life experiences/worldview."
michaelianblack,"@TVNewsandNotes As many pointed out, he conflated/equated the % of people getting assistance w/ % of people who support Obama"
michaelianblack,"@TVNewsandNotes He never mentioned the words ""welfare fraud,"" only discussed 47% of population as feeling ""victimized"" and ""entitled."""
michaelianblack,@TVNewsandNotes He wasn't talking about that. He specifically was talking about the 47% of the population he believed support Obama.
michaelianblack,"On a scale of ""pretty good-looking"" to ""very pretty good-looking,"" I rate my dental hygienist ""very pretty good-looking."""
