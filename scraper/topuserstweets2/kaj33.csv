kaj33,When I played against the Jazz they took us to 7 games in '88 but we won so I'm glad to see them still trailing behind the Lakers ..lol
kaj33,Fish just got fouled - if he puts down his free throws it will be right in the face of all the cheap shot Jazz fans
kaj33,thanks everyone for telling me about Twitvid.. I will be trying it out this week
kaj33,re tweet:The Lakers have to keep the crowd out of the game. A 4 to 8 point run will quiet them  & stomp on the neck of the Jazz
kaj33,The Lakers have to keep the crowd out of the game because a 4 to 8 point run will quiet them down & put a foot on the neck of the Jazz team

kaj33,I just saw Charles Barkley answer a fan live on tv - does anyone know how to do that on Twitter? I thought it was quite entertaining.
kaj33,@TheBlender23 I think Phoenix will have the same problem as the Jazz in that they can't match the Lakers size in the paint
kaj33,Everybody that has family members in the military are part of the glue that keeps our nation together. Hats off to all of them.
kaj33,@TylerDurton Showtime vs. The Current Squad: Kobe gives any team a shot but the Showtime Team & Bench were superlative.. My vote is Showtime
kaj33,@FritzPingol the low lifes in the stands that made reference to Dereks daughter's eye have about as much class as snot on a doornob!
kaj33,how many military families do we have out there tonight? I've been thinking of you all how much you have given for us all.
kaj33,@jacenallen my health is doing good. I am in remission and glad to still be here....
kaj33,"Jazz can't guard Pau in the post and Kobe on the outside simultaneously.
The crowd looks like they are watching a funeral."
kaj33,glad to see my Twitter fans are watching the game with me
kaj33,Shannon Brown has played very good off of the bench along w the rest of the Lakers bench players
kaj33,its the best Andrew can do playing hurt
kaj33,Andrew is coming in for short periods of time & having a positive effect
kaj33,The longer this round goes on the greater advantage the Lakers will have
kaj33,Utah does not have the horses to get it done tonight. They are turning over the ball to much. I doubt they can take 4 straight
kaj33,Lakers were very well prepared for this game -they are having a great defensive effort & their bench is doing a great job so far
kaj33,Its Cap and I'm back to give you some play by plays tonight's game during the second half. I'll start a few off during the 2nd Quarter ..
kaj33,I would expect the Lakers to win the first round. But they won't be able to put Oklahoma away until they start using their smarts..
kaj33,The Lakers can succeed if they use their smarts & experience to overcome Oklahomas youth & enthusiasm
kaj33,as he tries to overcome being double & tripled teamed. Oklahoma is focusing their defensive game on keeping the ball away from Pau & Andrew
kaj33,Last nights game shows what happens when the Lakers revert to bad habits. The team does not do well when they stand around & watch Kobe

kaj33,"http://www.paniniamerica.net/videos.cfm?vid=181
I guess Kobe got one of my cards in his pack!"
kaj33,& this can translate into a team commitment to put their best effort on the court every night.Andrew Bynum has been putting up great numbers
kaj33,The Lakers can fortunately gain their championship stride in a relatively easy manner. Each player must re-dedicate himself as an individual
kaj33,that its a long season (82) games and its difficult to maintain the Championship focus for many players.
kaj33,I'm sure that fans that follow the Lakers are concerned about the inconsistency's in their performances. This is probably due to the fact...
kaj33,"I will always think of Peter G when I repeat the lines ""We have clearance, Clarence"". 
I send my condolences to his family & friends. KAJ33"

kaj33,need to split to catch a flight....Lakers came back to win this one tonight but their going to need to be consistent to win the Playoffs
kaj33,Smith just shot the Nuggets out of the game
kaj33,@JeffAntoine we all know that the refs don't always get it right but that doesn't take away from Artest doing a great job
kaj33,Ron Artests defensive pressure finally got to Mello. Good job Ron!
kaj33,@DJBiggcheeez Pau plays the game in a way that make sense to Pau & it has been very effective so I don't criticize him
kaj33,@ChrisNOLADC point very well made
kaj33,@KI6BJV true but in the context of the NBA there seems to be a correlation
kaj33,@Ballerstweets I visited Chile in the early 1990's & the people there are very gracious & hospitable & I hope they recover soon
kaj33,I think people w macho tattoos are trying to make a statement. Its not like everyone in the NBA has been in the Navy..
kaj33,@NubianSage no need to apologize but whose winning the hockey game anyway?
kaj33,@Belliwi Lakers vs. Denver right now
kaj33,I think Pau not having tattoos is an expression of his confidence in his game in that he doesn't need 2 affirm his dominance w macho tattoos
kaj33,@chuckiebtoo The Defense makes the difference
kaj33,Nice drive by Lamar!
kaj33,@_SJD_  I wish I had that opportunity b:c I have done it in the past
kaj33,Mellos poor shooting is a direct result of Ron Artests defensive efforts in this game
kaj33,@soulz2003 He might have a chance but we have to wait to see how the end of the season plays out
kaj33,@pixxie13a I'm watching basketball today
kaj33,Lakers have closed the gap by creating turnovers this quarter. If they can continue to defend this well they will have a great chance to win
kaj33,@JayDel32 whoever is open on the Lakers has to have the confidence to take the shot - Kobe is getting doubled teamed
kaj33,Lakers D is making a difference -
kaj33,Carmelo looks like a sharp shooter
kaj33,Artest is having a great defensive game guarding Mello
kaj33,The Lakers need to be patient & work the ball inside where there size will make a difference
kaj33,The Lakers are making good defensive plays these past couple of times down the court
kaj33,What I just said was simple but knowing it and executing it are two different things.
kaj33,Lakers need to get a good shot everytime down court & then play  tough defense at the other end
kaj33,@fivepizme just needed a break for a while as I was dealing lots of other stuff
kaj33,@Scootch1 Coach Donohue was a very serious Celtics fan & he always challenged us to have the ball find the open man when I was in HS
kaj33,@lizzfilms I just spoke at the Cleveland Public Library  today. I;m heading to New Orleans next
kaj33,Bynum needs to pay attention to what's going on. The challenge for him is to understand what is happening on all parts of the court
kaj33,Carmelo  Anthony is one of the most consistent scorers in todays game & I enjoy watching him rise to the challenge every night
kaj33,"Ron Artests high school was La Salle Academy, which was my high schools rival"

kaj33,@rammerjammer74 my thought is that its too early to know what the post season will look like
kaj33,@GAVETH23 Bynums health is more a question of him staying in shape & staying away from those awkward situations where he has gotten injured
kaj33,@Ktwit23 right now I am trying to focus on making my documentary
kaj33,@JoshWidmer When the Lakers don't have Kobe they are not as predictable as they r w/Kobe. That makes it more difficult 2 defend against them
kaj33,"@DaveAkaSuper Denver, San Antonio & Portland all have very good teams & they all would like to beat the Lakers"
kaj33,@theesweet23 I think Lakers have the  talent 2 beat the Nuggets. But the Nuggets are hungry & determined & that determination can overcome
kaj33,@CYNTHIA_KENNER Ive been working very hard working on my documentary based on my book On the Shoulders of Giants
kaj33,@nerditry I would recommend someone who wants 2 learn the disclipine of meditation learn yoga. I have never practiced transc. meditation
kaj33,If the Lakers focus & commitment rises to the level of their talent they have a very good chance of doing very well in the post season.
kaj33,The Lakers may b still thinking of last years success rather than focusing on their goals for this year.
kaj33,@Vujachick the Lakers do not seem to play w a killer instinct on a steady basis.
kaj33,Andrew Bynum is doing well and he has worked hard to learn to what he needs to learn to contribute to his team.
kaj33,I'm doing well thanks for asking.
kaj33,I'll be flipping between the Lakers game and the Olympics

kaj33,Congrats to #Lamar Odom and Ms. #Kardashian on their pending nuptials!
kaj33,@JackWIII my point is THAT Limbaugh is incorrect. He injected race into this
kaj33,The reason I am speaking out against #Limbaugh is because concerned Americans should confront racist demagoguery from any source. KAJ33
kaj33,@JackWIII dont get your point its incoherent
kaj33,@Mutineer07 thats a hell of a statement!

kaj33,Its hard to imagine #Kathy Ireland losing any contest & I thought she looked great on the dance floor & I look forward to seeing her again!
kaj33,Mr. Limbaugh has nostalgia for a time when whites would win every encounter with non-whites. The laws that made possible no longer exist.
kaj33,I'm filming On the Shoulders @ the Armory in NYC .  I'll be out of pocket till tonight but then I will be back with more comments.
kaj33,"We all agree the incident was ugly but it had no racial context.
There was no chorus of black voices saying right on.. as Limbaugh stated"
kaj33,http://bit.ly/2FPWxX
kaj33,Why do you think Mr. Limbaugh has to blame this incident on issues of race? Lets start a discussion on this. I need to understand this.
kaj33,Racial animosity was not the cause of the incident and I resent Mr. Limbaugh's laying the blame on President Obama.
kaj33,Mr. Limbaugh feels that white kids are getting beat up because Obama is President & made the statement that this is Barack Obama's America
kaj33,Due 2 the fact that the aggressor was black & the other kid seemed 2 have no skill in defending himself Rush Limbaugh makes an absurd remark
kaj33,"It's unfortunate to see two young people throwing blows on a school bus.
American kids should be focused on learning not fighting. KAJ33"

kaj33,"Ariza wanted ""star money"" now but he's only 23 &  hasn't shown consistency year in and year out."
kaj33,If #Artest can handle his emotional issues he will be a great addition to the team.
kaj33,I thought #Ariza was quick & stealthy and did amazing things & I'll miss him on the team
kaj33,Artest is a formidable front line player but he is emotionally erratic so we'll see what happens.
kaj33,Ariza was trying 2 get more money because this was his first outstanding year. Artest was willing to sign for the money Ariza turned down
kaj33,my summer reading:The Biography of Satchel Paige- its very intstng because he pitched during the Harlem Renaissance & became a star athlete
kaj33,Signing #Artest was a thumb in the eye of Trevor Ariza because Artest signed for the same amount of money that they offered to #Ariza.

kaj33,It's about time they found Pau.
kaj33,Kobe is ready!
kaj33,"On this occasion Lamar Odom has risen like ""yeast"""
kaj33,Neither team has shot well in the 2nd half.
kaj33,Lamar strikes again with his 4th block
kaj33,We were not protecting the ball & taking good shots.
kaj33,Great pass from Gasol & his 5th block
kaj33,Kobe can't continue to try to dribble through a zone.
kaj33,Lamar is making a great display of talent & heart.
kaj33,No AB?
kaj33,Denver is in the bonus from here on. It will affect their Defense
kaj33,"Lakers are  getting diverse scoring, a key 4 them."
kaj33,This game will be won by the most efficient team from here on . Free throws will be big.
kaj33,Lamar Odom is everywhere in the 2nd half!
kaj33,It's the Lamar O show.
kaj33,Here is where the Lakers can take over the game.
kaj33,Odom makes things happen but Pau is our most efficient player. He needs to touch the ball moe oten.
kaj33,It looks like another chiller and thriller! Game tied @ each quarter
kaj33,Defense will do it every time.
kaj33,That's my boy Shannon Brown!
kaj33,Denver must not get 2nd shots!
kaj33,We cant allow Nuggets to get offensive rebounds!
kaj33,Lakes must limit Denver to 1 shot per possession.
kaj33,Kobe is warming up...
kaj33,If Carmelo gets going it will be a long nite 4 the Lakers.

kaj33,"Lakers have kept the Nuggets off the offensive boards 
Lakers:42  Nuggets: 44"
kaj33,Kobe will be fresh in the 2nd half and thats bad news for the Nuggets!
kaj33,Kobe 4pts - Andrew 9pts so far I'd say this is promising
kaj33,Bynum is having a good game so far
kaj33,I think the refs have been doing a good so far
kaj33,Sasha needs to stay calm and make his shots
kaj33,Anthony has not been much of a factor so far.
kaj33,Diverse scoring gives Denver problems. They can't focus on Kobe.
kaj33,Bynum is doing his job so far.
kaj33,Lakers won't get into foul trouble that way
kaj33,Nuggets have not been able to get to the the free throw line like they did last game..
kaj33,They will need to increase the intensity and focus throughout the game.
kaj33,Lakers have gotten off to a good start.
kaj33,"I wanted to wish Jerry West a Happy Birthday tomorrow!

kaj33,Denvers hustle & desire are making the difference in this game
kaj33,Odom has to find a way to get more involved in this game
kaj33,Bynum is going to have to step up his effort to get more minutes
kaj33,the reason Bynum is not a factor in this game is because he is not familiar with playoff intensity
kaj33,A comeback is not out of the question but they will have to get a more balanced effort
kaj33,Bynum is not being a factor in this game
kaj33,Mello is having a tough shooting performance
kaj33,Lakers need this kind of help from Odom
