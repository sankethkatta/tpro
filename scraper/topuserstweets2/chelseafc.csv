chelseafc,A match report on the defeat in Donetsk: http://t.co/JpWc4yqQ  #CFC
chelseafc,"RDM will be looking for his side to bounce back on Sunday, you can hear what he has to say on tonight's game here soon. #CFC"
chelseafc,"The hosts scored an early goal in each half to race into a 2-0 lead, and but for the heroics of Cech it would have been more. #CFC"
chelseafc,"It's all over in Donetsk as the Blues are beaten 2-1. Oscar's late goal gave us brief hope, but we can have no complaints. #CFC"
chelseafc,"GOAL: 2-1, Oscar fires home from close-range after good work by Sturridge and Ivanovic, two minutes left to play. #CFC"
chelseafc,"Great chance for Hazard who latches on to a Sturridge pass, but the keeper is equal to it and saves with his feet. #CFC"
chelseafc,"Decent move involving Mata, Oscar and Hazard, but the Belgian's effort is weak, Sturridge was unmarked in the middle. #CFC"
chelseafc,"Blues first sub of the night, Daniel Sturridge replaces Torres. #CFC"
chelseafc,"Poor challenge on Hazard by Kucher, the Belgian was through on goal and the defender is rightly booked. #CFC"
chelseafc,"Just under half an hour left to play, a real test of our character now.....#CFC"
chelseafc,Fernandinho fires wide after pouncing on a loose Terry clearance. Could be time for a change to personnel soon.  #CFC
chelseafc,Mikel looks hurt after falling awkwardly in an aerial challenge. #CFC
chelseafc,"2-0 to Shakhtar, Fernandinho finishes off a quick counter-attack after Hazard was lost possession six minutes into the second half. #CFC"
chelseafc,"Best Chelsea chance of the night as Hazard finds Mata, but the latter's strike is high and wide. Decent start to the half #CFC"
chelseafc,"Second half underway, Torres has an early strike but it cannons off Oscar before it could trouble the keeper. #CFC"
chelseafc,RT @DJTrevorNelson: I still fancy Chelsea to get something out of this game.
chelseafc,"RT @FrankMSinclair: #Willian absolutely running the show, top player."
chelseafc,RT @DarrenBarker82: COME ON CHELSEA! #CFC #KTBFFH
chelseafc,"All the pre-match talk was of John Terry, but it's Petr Cech who has been responsible for keeping the home side at bay. #CFC"
chelseafc,"Half-time whistle goes, Texeira's goal the difference thus far. In truth, we're fortunate to only be 1-0 down and must improve. #CFC"
chelseafc,Ivanovic finds Torres with a cross from the right but the striker's volley is comfortable for the keeper. #CFC
chelseafc,"Another great stop by Cech, this time to deny Mkhitaryan. #CFC"
chelseafc,Great ball by Oscar to pick out Torres but the Spaniard is unable to get his shot away under pressure. #CFC
chelseafc,"Offensively, the Blues have looked pretty lively so far, but equally the home side are causing us plenty of problems at the back. #CFC"
chelseafc,Cech saves well from a curling Willian effort. The Brazilian has been a constant threat during these early stages. #CFC
chelseafc,21 minutes played and Ashley Cole is the first man into the referee's book #CFC
chelseafc,17 minutes played and Hazard replaces Lampard. Looks like Ramires will drop into the deeper role he's occupied of late #CFC
chelseafc,"Looks like an early change, Lampard in some discomfort and his night will be coming to a premature end as Hazard strips #CFC"
chelseafc,"Willian goes close for the hosts, running at the Blues back-four before his strike flew narrowly over the bar. #CFC"
chelseafc,Worst possible start for the Blues against a side who are unbeaten this season as Oscar's deflected shot is easily saved #CFC
chelseafc,Chelsea behind inside three minutes. David Luiz fails to clear his lines and as the ball fell to Texeira he fired past Cech. Poor start #CFC

chelseafc,Mikel receiving a great ovation on his 250th appearance for the club as John Terry heads narrowly wide. #CFC
chelseafc,"Oriol Romeu now about to enter the fray, John Mikel Obi the player making way. #CFC"

chelseafc,"RT @OptaJoe: 4 - @juanmata10 has the joint-most assists in the Premier League this season, along with @hazardeden10. Playmakers."
chelseafc,"Cesar Azpilicueta makes his league bow for the Blues, replacing Ivanovic, not a bad way for the Serbian to sign off for the day. #CFC"
chelseafc,"GOAL: 4-1, a stunning volley by Ivanovic surely puts the game to bed, good ball by Oscar initially before Mata got the eventual assist. #CFC"
chelseafc,"John Terry urging his team-mates to quicken the pace in terms of our passing, Torres goes clean through but Ruddy saves well. #CFC"
chelseafc,Ramires forces a corner after clever play from Hazard. #CFC
chelseafc,"Ramires comes on for Lampard, the midfielder appeared to be intimating he had picked up a knock, great 1st half display by Lamps. #CFC"
chelseafc,"Looks like we could soon be seeing the introduction of Ramires, the Brazilian is currently warming up after words with RDM .#CFC"
chelseafc,"Good defending by Luiz after Lampard loses the ball, but the Brazilian's pass is too heavy for the advancing Torres to meet. #CFC"
chelseafc,"Now it's Mata's turn to go close as he latches on to a Hazard pass, Ruddy saves well after coming off his line quickly. #CFC"
chelseafc,Our first serious attempt on goal of the half comes from Oscar who stings the palms of John Ruddy from the edge of the box. #CFC
chelseafc,"Russell Martin tries his luck from distance for the visitors, decent attempt but Cech wasn't seriously troubled. #CFC"
chelseafc,"Hazard takes a tumble inside the box, home crowd appeal for a penalty but Anthony Taylor waves the appeals away. #CFC"

chelseafc,Into the last couple of minutes of the half as Grant Holt heads narrowly over the bar. #CFC
chelseafc,"Great tackle by Lampard wins the ball back, he then feeds Oscar who is unlucky with a side-footed effort from the edge of the box. #CFC"
chelseafc,"That was Hazard's second goal for the club, his first from open play, all stemmed from a fantastic defensive header by Terry #CFC"
chelseafc,"GOAL: 3-1, stunning counter-attack sees Mata release Hazard who finishes in style, great goal, great response to going behind #CFC"

chelseafc,"Lampard's 189th goal for the club, he now trails Kerry Dixon by only four goals in the all-time list, outstanding for a midfielder #CFC"
chelseafc,"GOAL: 2-1 to the Blues, Torres went for the acrobatic and as the ball fell into the path of Lampard he fired home impressively. #CFC"
chelseafc,Great chance for Tettey to restore the visitors' lead but it's a poor header and Chelsea clear #CFC
chelseafc,"Great response by the Blues, Hazard scuffs a chance to put us in front after great work by Torres #CFC"
chelseafc,"GOAL: 1-1, Chelsea hit back instantly, lovely move involving Lampard, Mata, Ivanovic ends with a cracking header by Fernando Torres #CFC"

chelseafc,Patient Chelsea play - Oscar slipping his marker to take a Torres lay-off and square to his fellow Brazilian - who couldn't miss. #CFC
chelseafc,4-0 - Ramires from point-blank range. #CFC #ChampionsLeague
chelseafc,The young Laudrup comes on for the Danes the final five mins. Lampard fires over. #CFC #ChampionsLeague
chelseafc,"Mata went off after the goal, replaced by Mikel. #CFC #ChampionsLeague"
chelseafc,"The ball rebounds in the Spaniard's favour after a quick interchange involving him, Oscar and Lamps. A clean finish. #CFC #ChampionsLeague."
chelseafc,Mata makes it 3-0. 81 mins playerd. #CFC #ChampionsLeague
chelseafc,"From further and wider out than Mata's a moment earlier, the Brazilian smashes a free-kick in off the post. Breathing space. #CFC"
chelseafc,2-0 Chelsea - David Luiz scores.  #CFC #ChampionsLeague
chelseafc,Mata's free-kick is into the wall. #CFC #ChampionsLeague
chelseafc,Ramires is taken out by a tackle just outside the area. The ref gets his yellow card out. #CFC #ChampionsLeague
chelseafc,It was a touch by Cech that turned the shot onto the post. Great goalkeeping. #CFC #ChampionsLeague.
chelseafc,"A big escape for Chelsea as a forceful attack by John ends with the striker hitting the post, and Cech then saves on the follow up. #CFC"
chelseafc,Chelsea have the right to feel hard done by as decisions against Oscar and Hazard in quick succession prevent attacks. #CFC #ChampionsLeague
chelseafc,First change by RDM - Hazard on for Moses whose European debut is at an end. 65 mins played. Still 1-0 up. #CFC #ChampionsLeague.
chelseafc,"The Blues allow too much space down our left and the cross comes in, but Beckmann blazes wide.  #CFC #ChampionsLeague"
chelseafc,Now Cech is forced to save a shot from Stockholm. The pressure stays on until the home team concede a free-kick. #CFC #ChampionsLeague
chelseafc,Chelsea allow the Danes a chance - Beckmann escaping round the back but heading off target. A warning! #CFC #ChampionsLeague
chelseafc,"Moses, who's seeing far more of the ball in this half, fires it in Torres's direction, but the striker is crowded out. #CFC #ChampionsLeague"
chelseafc,That is the closest Norsdjaelland have come - Joshua John shooting low and just wide of the post. 51 mins played. #CFC #ChampionsLeague
chelseafc,Oscar almost weights a good pass through to Torres but the keeper is quickly out to interfere.  #CFC #ChampionsLeague
chelseafc,"Nordsjaelland get the game going again, trailing to Juan Mata's goal. #CFC #ChampionsLeague"
chelseafc,Chelsea go in 1-0 up at half-time - probably the minimum requirement at this stage of the game. #CFC #ChampionsLeague
chelseafc,"Torres should have made it 2-0 - slipped through by Oscar, but he hits the keeper with his shot. Then he nets from an offside position. #CFC"
chelseafc,Committed defending by Cahill as he heads behind. Ivanovic heads away when the corner comes in. #CFC #ChampionsLeague
chelseafc,Chelsea back on top since the goal. The game being played in the Danes' half.  #CFC #ChampionsLeague
chelseafc,"32 mins played when Torres wins the ball, Lampard shows great vision to roll it into Mata's path for a 1st time finish. #CFC"
chelseafc,GOAL - Juan Mata. #CFC #Champions League
chelseafc,"David Luiz is trying to get Chelsea playing with long, crossfield balls - but they're missing their targets. Still 0-0.#CFC #ChampionsLeague"
chelseafc,Save by the keeper from Torres after a careless header by a Nordsjaelland defender. Torres could have carried the ball further there. #CFC
chelseafc,The Blues have let our grip on this game slip a bit. It needs a good Cole block to prevent shot on goal. 20 mins in. #CFC #ChampionsLeague
chelseafc,First moments of pressure from the home side - a mistake by Cole leads to a shot that doesn't trouble Cech. #CFC  #ChampionsLeague.
chelseafc,"10 mins played. Lampard has his first shot, from edge of the area, not too far over. All #CFC at the moment but still 0-0. #ChampionsLeague"
chelseafc,Chelsea hit the post via Moses's close-range header under heavy pressure. Oscar crossed. #CFC #Champions League.
chelseafc,Blues first to attack - Moses backheels to Oscar who rolls the ball across the six-yard box and wide. #CFC #ChampionsLeague
chelseafc,We're underway. Torres and Oscar kick the game off.  #CFC
chelseafc,Here come the teams... #CFC http://t.co/f6aFlZEE

chelseafc,It ends Chelsea 5 Wolves 0 at the Bridge. Manager Dermot Drummy will delighted with that display. #CFC
chelseafc,Piazon makes it 5-0 to Chelsea U21s. Piazon won a penalty and dispatched it himself to cap an all-round classy performance. #CFC
chelseafc,Skipper Kane is replaced by Fankaty Dabo as we enter the final 10 minutes. #CFC
chelseafc,"Second change from Dermot Drummy sees Musonda now get on, replacing Bamford. Boga has moved forward as the central striker. #CFC"
chelseafc,GOAL! 4-0 Chelsea. Superb play involving Bamford and Boga ends with Baker slotting past a helpless McCarey. #CFC
chelseafc,"Blackman made a crucial save before that second-half goal rush, tipping Ismail's effort behind after it came through a crowded box. #CFC"
chelseafc,GOAL! 3-0 Chelsea. Deen-Conteh bursts down the left from inside his own half before finishing neatly down low past McCarey. #CFC
chelseafc,GOAL! 2-0 Chelsea. Boga finishes off an excellent Chelsea counter-attack after being fed in by Baker.
chelseafc,"Correction: that's Boga replacing Loftus-Cheek, not Musonda. #CFC"
chelseafc,Chelsea change after 51 minutes. Tika Musonda replaces Ruben Loftus-Cheek in midfield. #CFC

chelseafc,"Blackman called into a bit more action last few minutes, comfortably saving low free-kick before a neat turn from Winnall is smothered. #CFC"

chelseafc,RT @henrywinter: Atletico Madrid fans singing Fernando Torres' name for about a minute #class

chelseafc,"Former Newcastle man Emre is replacing the hat-trick man Falcao, who receives standing ovation from Chelsea fans.  #SuperCup (SL)"

chelseafc,Gary Cahill has smashed a goal back for us after a corner. 4-1 with 16 to go... #SuperCup (SL)

chelseafc,RT @DarrenBarker82: Sod it come on CHELSEA! #CFCMonaco
chelseafc,RT @OptaJoe: 3 - Falcao is the first player to score a Super Cup hat-trick since Terry McDermott for Liverpool v Hamburg in 1977. Rare.
chelseafc,The 2nd half is underway with Oscar on for Ramires. #SuperCup (SL)
chelseafc,That's half-time. Chelsea 0-3 Atletico. #SuperCup (SL)
chelseafc,One added minute before half-time. A lot of work to do at the break... #SuperCup (SL)
chelseafc,"Atletico go three up, Falcao hat-trick after another swift break and smart pass from Turan. 44 mins. #SuperCup (SL)"
chelseafc,Somehow it is not 3-0. Atletico see an effort blocked and another hit the post. Would have been a Falcao hat-trick. #SuperCup (SL)
chelseafc,Superb save from Cech to deny Gabi. Chelsea should have had a free-kick before Atletico broke for foul on Ivanovic. #SuperCup (SL)
chelseafc,Poor start at the back from Chelsea. #SuperCup (SL)

chelseafc,RT @ChelseaStats: Mikel shows some skill and composure but Chelsea fail to get shot on goal.
chelseafc,"Chelsea press with Lampard, Mata and Ramires but the Brazilian cant pick a cross. #SuperCup (SL)"
chelseafc,Excellent finish from the striker. Goal from a smart through ball. Chelsea defence too easily breached. #SuperCup (SL)
chelseafc,"Goal for Atletico, Falcao chipping beyond Cech and in off the post. 0-1 after six minutes. #SuperCup (SL)"
