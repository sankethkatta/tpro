jack_welch,@BoomChuckalucca ill take 2of 3
jack_welch,@ValoremLamb agree
jack_welch,@davidgregory I think Gingrich Durbin debate was excellent. Liberal overstated perhaps but certainly left of center.  Nice closing remarks
jack_welch,MTP panel 3-1 liberal. Kills real discussion
jack_welch,@ peterek123 agree need new faces to carry same messages.
jack_welch,Clear that vast majority want to take Ortiz out of lineup and find dignified answer to his problem. DL list??
jack_welch,Great MTP debate coming up today. Two party stalwarts Durbin vs Gingrich go at it. At least it will be good discussion of policy

jack_welch,@mtangredi I'd like to see him traded. No hit No range
jack_welch,Lot of Mets fans here. Man can they holler. Lot more than Yankees do.
jack_welch,Papi doesn't look like Major leaguer. 2K's and DP. Hate to see it
