brunoierullo,"Request asking me to send clothing to a celeb musician, usually I dont mind as long they are decent and respect people- to me its important"

brunoierullo,Use your freedom your mind look and decide at what you want from life dont be misled by others that want to decide for you.
brunoierullo,Award shows are big money makers for TV created events that try to make you like a song or movie more its all one big fake promotion machine
brunoierullo,i exhaust my creativity to deliver best collection i can season to season i dont believe in fake marketing schemes or advertising illusions
brunoierullo,My collection is limited most hand made work taking months to finish less than 100 of ea garment available retaining exclusivity to customer
brunoierullo,Mass production in fashion is a scattering of millions of garments with life span of few months quality is only possible in small prod runs
brunoierullo,"@Lana_Layne and vintage clothing has to have its origins and come from somewhere, it was new at one time but retains some lasting quality"
brunoierullo,Mass production has no place in fashion its the fast food of clothing a standby- real clothes are with meaning something u want to keep yrs
