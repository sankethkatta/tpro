richardpbacon,"@dazimac yes, the bar beneath Hix on Brewer Street, best place Milk and Honey. Also the cocktail bar inside the Connaught."
richardpbacon,PanAm makes you desperately nostalgic for a period you didn't live thru & didn't really exist. Bland characters & dialogue yet still magic.
richardpbacon,@AZARIAPR hey thank you
richardpbacon,@londonandrew sweet
richardpbacon,That #MarrShow was a particular vintage. And having Alfie Boe sing Bring Him Home on Remembrance Sunday was a bloody masterstroke.
