realdonaldtrump,"Obama weak on immigration. All words, no action. He's been Prez 4 years."
realdonaldtrump,Obama is looking rhetorical and weak. @MittRomney is looking strong and sharp.
realdonaldtrump,"Obama just said @MittRomney was ""a very successful investor""--- big mistake for Obama to admit- he has less and less credibility."
realdonaldtrump,Obama keeps saying that he will do something--- but why hasn't he done it? It's all talk.
realdonaldtrump,.@MittRomney looks much stronger and much more Presidential!
realdonaldtrump,So far @MittRomney is winning big.
realdonaldtrump,Then how come gasoline is hitting record high prices?
realdonaldtrump,Good response on jobs by @MittRomney.
realdonaldtrump,Why has Obama let China and others take our jobs?
realdonaldtrump,Why hasn't Obama created jobs?
realdonaldtrump,"Getting ready to watch the debate--- as they say ""let's get ready to rumble""!"
realdonaldtrump,I was just told by one of the top @PGATOUR players that my golf courses are the most elite in the country. Very nice compliment--I agree.
realdonaldtrump,We should be able to negotiate a deal with Iran because they know we could blow them away to the Stone Age.They just don't believe we would.
realdonaldtrump,@drumline_mormon  It is selling great at Macy's--thanks!
realdonaldtrump,"For political purposes only, Obama is planning to hit Libya for the Benghazi embassy attack right before the election?"
realdonaldtrump,Great win last night by Peyton Manning &amp; @Denver_Broncos in San Diego coming from 24 points behind on the road. Very impressive.
realdonaldtrump,If the @yankees can somehow beat Verlander tonight then they can still salvage the series. And I will go to games 6&amp; 7 so they will win!
realdonaldtrump,Get ready for tonight!
realdonaldtrump,@MissUSA  Olivia--we love you. You are doing a great job.
realdonaldtrump,.@MittRomney--if Obama gets wise tonight just ask for his college records &amp; transcripts--he will quiet down quickly.
realdonaldtrump,Good luck @MittRomney tonight--have no doubt you will be great.
realdonaldtrump,Congratulations to @JamesOKeefeIII on exposing more Democrat voter fraud.  @DNC was caught red handed telling people to vote twice.
realdonaldtrump,I bet the terrorists in Libya used weapons we supplied them during their so called 'revolution' to attack our embassy in Benghazi.

realdonaldtrump,Obama will be trying very hard at next debate- he doesn't want to lose the Boeing.
realdonaldtrump,Who says Obama will do better in the next debate- has he gotten smarter in 2 weeks!

realdonaldtrump,They found Jessica in Colorado--- body was mutilated--- death to the pervert killer.
realdonaldtrump,Joe Girardi did a great job of managing the Yankees this series.
realdonaldtrump,I'll bet Obama goes down just like Washington because he doesn't use our(this country's) best people to win.
