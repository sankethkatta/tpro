suzeormanshow,@sassycarrie look under exclusions.  Does it say wind damage is excluded
suzeormanshow,For those of you not effected.  Now is the time to take out your insurance policy and find out would you have been covered.  Find out before
suzeormanshow,@orlean6 I am so sorry but it is important that we all know this before something happens.  Don't feel sick just find out will they cover?
suzeormanshow,@rashan_ that will be a fight for most insurance companies.
suzeormanshow,@TraderJones2011  it does not matter that was the fight everyone had in New Orleans.
suzeormanshow,"@orlean6 if your damage was $30000 with the previous example they would only cover $10000.  $20,000 is your deductible."
suzeormanshow,@orlean6   If the damage was just $15000 and your home is worth 400k with a 5% deductible  or 20k you are not covered. Did that make sense
suzeormanshow,@grechukj 5 % of the value of the home
suzeormanshow,"If you have a home worth 400k and your hurricane deductible is 5% your ins company will not cover that first 20k 
Do not take out 401k loans"

suzeormanshow,This is now when you are going to find out if it was worth it for you to get the cheapest policy out there or if you should have paid more
suzeormanshow,You should all tweet if your insurance company is honoring you or trying to not pay you.  Let people know what ins companies are ethical
suzeormanshow,Have everything together so the adjuster knows you know your rights. Be strong for you may have to fight for what you really deserve
suzeormanshow,Also don't forget your trees and shrubs etc are covered under most of your home policies so don't forget them. They have value
suzeormanshow,If you are displaced from your home many of your insurance companies should pay for you to stay somewhere like a hotel etc.  check it out
suzeormanshow,Do not be afraid to fight for what you are really owed.  Be careful about taking checks from ins and signing off on it.  Know what you sign
suzeormanshow,While everything is fresh in your head write down everything you think has been lost or damaged and value.
suzeormanshow,Remember insurance under your fire provision will pay you more than under hurricane for hurricane has a 5% or so deductible. Fire does not
suzeormanshow,If your house has been damaged by fire most likely they will say it was caused by the hurricane damaging the transformer.
suzeormanshow,"Remember it is times like this that con artists come out so don't get hurt twice. 
Take pics of everything now."
suzeormanshow,Be careful who you pay to clean something up.  Wait till you have seen your insurance adj. don't give cash to anyone to do anything.
suzeormanshow,You have to know was the damage done by the hurricane or the flood for that is where they will get you.  That is why flood ins is so needed
suzeormanshow,Always be there when the insurance adjuster comes.  Their job is to represent the insurance company so know your rights.
suzeormanshow,If a tree fell on your car that will fall under your car insurance.   If it fell on your house that is your home ins.
suzeormanshow,Now lets talk money.  All of you who suffered damage need to get out your insurance policies.  Check what the deductible is on your home ins
suzeormanshow,So our elec went on pretty much a few minutes after it went out we were very lucky.  Hearts to all of you who are struggling through this
suzeormanshow,Ok. We just lost electricity.  It lasted longer than we thought.  The flooding is something else

suzeormanshow,@ninasophia81 @latasha_jean @rkbtwo @darlabunting @niaelaine  Thank you - I know you are.
suzeormanshow,@ryancmack @Latasha_Jean @rkbtwo @ninasophia81 @DarlaBunting @NiaElaine  No email from you- at all
suzeormanshow,@ryancmack @Latasha_Jean @rkbtwo @ninasophia81 @DarlaBunting @NiaElaine  now you are legal game for when you say things that are not factual
suzeormanshow,@ryancmack @Latasha_Jean @rkbtwo @ninasophia81 @DarlaBunting @NiaElaine  Then Ryan do it with truths and facts and being responsibe
suzeormanshow,@ryancmack @Latasha_Jean @rkbtwo @ninasophia81 @DarlaBunting @NiaElaine That book was 13 years ago- ALOT has changed
suzeormanshow,@RecessionLesson I would like a whole new one- but time will tell
suzeormanshow,@ryancmack @Latasha_Jean @rkbtwo @ninasophia81 @DarlaBunting @NiaElaine   Why did you not return my email- rather go on CNN and bash me
suzeormanshow,@Latasha_Jean YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.  But you know in the end the truth always emerges.  And I always stand in the truth again my actions speak
suzeormanshow,@NiaElaine @rkbtwo @ninasophia81 @latasha_jean @darlabunting  I sent an email to his address he did not respond- I have a letter I wrote
suzeormanshow,@rkbtwo We can have any conversation you want. Wealth is not bad- it is how you use it that determines its meaning
suzeormanshow,@RecessionLesson YOU HAVE THAT RIGHT.  The system today is not working. People who are about to go bankrupt have good scores- outdated
suzeormanshow,@Latasha_Jean You know mr RYAN never did respond to my email so I could talk to him today-that is because he does not want to know the truth
suzeormanshow,@NiaElaine @rkbtwo @ninasophia81 @latasha_jean @darlabunting  You got it- it will take about 18 months but then we will know-
suzeormanshow,@rkbtwo @ninasophia81 @latasha_jean @darlabunting @niaelaine  Nope just proof that people who pay in cash are credit worthy-
suzeormanshow,@crown562 THe Elephant keeps walking as the dogs keep barking
suzeormanshow,@Latasha_Jean @rkbtwo @ninasophia81 @DarlaBunting @NiaElaine  All prepaid cards are at this bank- it is a commercial bank not retail
suzeormanshow,@ninasophia81 @latasha_jean @rkbtwo @darlabunting @niaelaine  That is why I am doing this- I have their ear and they respect what I say
suzeormanshow,@Latasha_Jean @rkbtwo @ninasophia81 @DarlaBunting @NiaElaine They are the bank behind it- but they put NO MONEY IN IT  and they are FDIC INS
suzeormanshow,@Latasha_Jean @rkbtwo @ninasophia81 @DarlaBunting @NiaElaine I dont care if you get my card or not I just dont want you to get bad info
suzeormanshow,@Latasha_Jean @rkbtwo @ninasophia81 @DarlaBunting @NiaElaine you high five yourself for maybe you know more than he does.
suzeormanshow,@Latasha_Jean @rkbtwo @ninasophia81 @DarlaBunting @NiaElaine he also told you that I did not have any money in this- He is wrong
suzeormanshow,@Latasha_Jean @rkbtwo @ninasophia81 @DarlaBunting @NiaElaine If you have bounced checks and you are in the chex system they will not take U
suzeormanshow,@Latasha_Jean @rkbtwo @ninasophia81 @DarlaBunting @NiaElaine @ryancmack If that is true why do millions of people have these cards
suzeormanshow,@NiaElaine Maybe but not for a long long time if ever. What is the difference of this and my books etc.  I make money there but you learn
suzeormanshow,@Latasha_Jean @rkbtwo @ninasophia81 @DarlaBunting @NiaElaine  I can give you four cards for  75 cents a month each -with education etc
suzeormanshow,@Latasha_Jean @rkbtwo @ninasophia81 @DarlaBunting @NiaElaine   many people cannot get bank accounts and this was the only way I could do it
suzeormanshow,@DarlaBunting @rkbtwo  Well if certain entities have their way it will not be.  But I will not give up doing what I know is right
suzeormanshow,@Latasha_Jean there are plenty-NY TIMES  FORBES- CHICAGO TRIBUNE  YAHOO_ etc etc- but I am trying to get you to ask your own questions
suzeormanshow,@rkbtwo Yes but here is what is sad. Others pretend like they are helping and they are just promoting their own agenda off of your fears
suzeormanshow,@TexasAlum Just so a little-
suzeormanshow,@rkbtwo but sometimes wealth is needed to help change the world and when wealth is in the right hands it can create more for all
suzeormanshow,@rkbtwo @ninasophia81 @Latasha_Jean @DarlaBunting @NiaElaine  I will always respond you have questions I will answer
suzeormanshow,@ninasophia81 @Latasha_Jean @DarlaBunting @NiaElaine @rkbtwo  Now I have the wealth to help all of you and I am doing just
suzeormanshow,"@ninasophia81 @Latasha_Jean @DarlaBunting @NiaElaine @rkbtwo  Do you see how I am paying $50,000 for people to learn-and now you doubt me?"
suzeormanshow,@ninasophia81 @Latasha_Jean @DarlaBunting @NiaElaine @rkbtwo Are you watching my class on OWN. Are you seeing the tools I am giving away
suzeormanshow,@Latasha_Jean Do you think REAL LEADERS of the community would back me if it was not true that night. My past actions speak the truth
suzeormanshow,@Latasha_Jean   we have done that by all the interviews I have given. If you are confused about something why dont you ask me
suzeormanshow,@ninasophia81 it is.  You will see.
suzeormanshow,@hrcubsgirl $5000 if you are under 50
suzeormanshow,@hrcubsgirl You should just do a ROTH- far better in the long run
suzeormanshow,@cestlav76 Yep the title of the house has to be changed into the trust- a title company can do that
suzeormanshow,@hrcubsgirl are you sure that is how they match- can you check that one more time
suzeormanshow,@ninasophia81 You should know that you are not being told the truth. I have over one million dollars invested in this card. He is wrong
suzeormanshow,@Latasha_Jean  Just so you know I have invested over One Million of my own dollars in this card.  You source is again plain wrong

suzeormanshow,Off to do THE VIEW_ tune in   Also one last thing just take a look at this and make up your own mind.  http://t.co/gZXU1bVB
suzeormanshow,@URFinanceSimple referring to 2012
suzeormanshow,@Disneymom1208 Remember this is just PMI premiums not mortgage payments
suzeormanshow,@jjmtwitt I would be putting 20% down
suzeormanshow,@JoshMillerREMAX that is why I am telling you all this - remember it is just PMI- not mortgage payments themselves
suzeormanshow,@URFinanceSimple THey voted it down- you missed it- as of January 1 2012 it is over
suzeormanshow,@B_rent_ YEP
suzeormanshow,@Disneymom1208 Not as of January1-  prior to that you could
suzeormanshow,So the answer is NO you cannot write of your PMI premiums anymore- that is one reason I have been saying you need to put 20% down
suzeormanshow,@nielslesniewski correct
suzeormanshow,@luluxvii thank you
suzeormanshow,@gigi0327 you now cut back on expenses like you are NOT going to get another job- so that you stretch that 8 month emergency fund to a year-

suzeormanshow,@MadMad98 which one was Boring
suzeormanshow,Have been tweeting this wk about the markets europe-gold DWTS & Justin Beiber but here is the most important tweet yet http://t.co/12PUe8tp
suzeormanshow,@joannepascal you just call your brokerage firm sell what you want and buy what you want.  You should follow the money navigator on my site
suzeormanshow,"@bobbyciletti nope just DWTS and AI
then it is CNBC etc all the way"
suzeormanshow,@maddythedog do the dishes everyday for a month for her
suzeormanshow,Aren't you thankful we said to stay away from Bank Stocks wow B of A at $5.29.  Amazing
suzeormanshow,really he was LS. Why can't things be real anymore.  Well one thing for sure the only lip sinking I do is a Suze smackdown @joannepascal
suzeormanshow,@shelly_d I want you out of Core etc and want you to follow my newsletter. I could not have been more disappointed in DWA if I tried.
suzeormanshow,Yes our boy hit it out of the ball good for you JB. I am still a fan.
suzeormanshow,@SandydeMarchena Ojal usted y los suyos una Accin de Gracias muy feliz
suzeormanshow,Oh good our JB sounds great. Is that him really singing I sure hope so. I love when great kid performers become great adult performers
suzeormanshow,@LaurenFeher or that helps him stay on key and coverup his changing voice. Hmmmmm
suzeormanshow,Euro finally broke 1.34-it shld really go to 1.17 but it's stubborn. TO REPEAT gold could cont down use BIG dips to buy no more 15% of port
suzeormanshow,Going  to watch Justin Beiber on Today to see if he can sing on key. Poor guy. Growing up can be hard on the voice-wanting him to do great
suzeormanshow,@StarKaraoke remember I like gold more than silver.
suzeormanshow,as far as giving gift cards for the holidays @DrSandyStocky as long as they are generic.  Not for a specific store
suzeormanshow,So I heard from many of you I was mentioned on the show Parenthood. What was said?

suzeormanshow,Noooooooooooooo
suzeormanshow,"Don't be surprised if it is between Rob and Rikki and JR is the first one out 
Time will tell.  Picking a winning stock is so much easier"
suzeormanshow,My vote is in Rikki will win
suzeormanshow,@SLCBudman sorry doll money is a 24hr a day job so no DWTS for me
suzeormanshow,@Caleurogal stop looking
suzeormanshow,@Ty33909 no
suzeormanshow,@luigichargerfan rikki
suzeormanshow,Rob just blew it
suzeormanshow,"@Rosie Rosie you should do DWTS 
Happy t day will you be in FLA"
suzeormanshow,Rikki may have won with that tango
suzeormanshow,"The DWTS final is here- they all really did great if you ask me-
what is so funny is I cannot even remember who won last yr- 
here we go"
suzeormanshow,Now now @DogDayAftern00n  there are still some joys that everyone can have-
suzeormanshow,@KK19YQZ could be- it all depends
suzeormanshow,Now that was a great tweet- it made me laugh @de_shonda
suzeormanshow,I would not touch a time share @tyee_cruz with a ten foot pole
suzeormanshow,@jack I love this pic of you
suzeormanshow,Who do you think will win DWTS tonight
suzeormanshow,It is only three stories @docscott999

suzeormanshow,@Gentleman1906 I was invested in it but it became too speculative for me about six months ago
suzeormanshow,@Katia_12009 NOPE
suzeormanshow,@schnovey Start googling GOLD ETFS- GLD is a favorite of many - I personally do not own that one so I can talk about it-
suzeormanshow,@Pinkunic I would wait to buy Euros
suzeormanshow,Gold is going back up today- remember gold will go up down up down- if you are buying gold you are doing it for a year from now in  2012
suzeormanshow,In the year 2008 I wrote a booked called the 2009 Action Plan @Katia_12009 on page 6 in that book it says it will take till at least 2014-15
suzeormanshow,Again I wish you were right @TheDewMonster but I am essentially six months away from being 61- hard to believe I know but it is true
suzeormanshow,I have to tell you @Katia_12009 I wish you were correct and it was the SC- but the problem is so much bigger than that I am sorry to say
suzeormanshow,"Do you remember- that in 1963 on this very day ,  THE POTUS John Kennedy, was fatally shot.  I was i 12 yrs old and I will never forget it"
suzeormanshow,as you look at the markets I do not think what you are seeing is because the super comt failed. Everyone knew they would fail. Europe is key
suzeormanshow,It is possible in 2012 you most likely will see the world deleverage after a generation of governments promising more than they can pay for
suzeormanshow,@Trinkaboo did you go to the white Castles and Mcdonalds on 79th
suzeormanshow,@Audrey00211 not those judges - you either dance or you dont- they dont care- they are pros big time my love

suzeormanshow,@whodatholly NEVER
suzeormanshow,@johnmarc I dont think so
suzeormanshow,"Can you believe it- I did not really get to watch DWTS- ugggggggg
But I will watch it when it is online-why do I get a feeling ROB could win"

suzeormanshow,@pluckinstrings I do have a fico4you kit that I sell on QVC- 4 transunion REAL fico scores and reports for $28 and that is a steal of a deal

suzeormanshow,@JanetMarieDavis She is a better woman than I
suzeormanshow,@AFlyingDutchmen because reminded to do something does not mean that you do it- you need a reminder set every day till you do it-
suzeormanshow,@bigtang1 I get that but most of them not all- but most did it all themselves- but I do not pick them I just answer the question.I hear you
suzeormanshow,Even though these markets are tough here today- it should be expected however all I am thinking about is the finals of DWTS- is that bad?
suzeormanshow,@bigtang1 actually I do-
suzeormanshow,@Nova_Avon22 One sale at a time
suzeormanshow,"AN AD THAT SAYS SOMETHING IS FREE- AND THEY ASK YOU TO GIVE A CCARD # THAT WILL BE CHARGE $14,95 A MONTH IF YOU DONT CANCEL IN 7 DAYS - DONT"
suzeormanshow,"@FCSdotcom u ask for a crdt or dbt card  to get it free & in smaller print in 7 days they will be charged  $14.95 a mth till cancel
REALLY?"
suzeormanshow,@shellkay13 so you can use a 529 plan but you might want to just save it in cash till these markets work themselves out
suzeormanshow,@FCSdotcom what do you offer and do the consumers to get what you offer do they need to give a credit card
suzeormanshow,@shellkay13 what is your goal for this money
suzeormanshow,"RT @OprahWinfreyNet: ""No woman can control her destiny if she doesnt give TO herself as much as she gives OF herself. - @SuzeOrmanShow ..."

suzeormanshow,@TexasAlum I don't
suzeormanshow,@InvestmentMind honey they all are acting as if they are clueless.  So she is the smartest of them all
suzeormanshow,@nonsense713 of course it does but the real problem at hand is Europe Mr SA
suzeormanshow,The reasons the markets are in trouble here is about Europe and Europe alone.  The only person giving me hope is Christine Laigarde smart

Very sad. We need to raise taxes on the wealthy and cut write-offs etc"

suzeormanshow,there is only one word to describe the @CarmenLovelace   LOSERS the only thing super about them is they all are SUPER DISAPPOINTING
suzeormanshow,I like gold here @goddessdiva7 so I would buy a little. As long as it stays above $1600 I am a liking it. If Euro goes below $1.30 gold up
