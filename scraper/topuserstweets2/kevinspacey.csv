kevinspacey,BTW/Chavez is not my friend/Met him once but never supported him. Do not assume I do. Do NOT support what he is doing against free press/RT
kevinspacey,@KaylaMurphy3 It's okay. You are entitled to your opinion. Don't worry about it.
kevinspacey,@sharbowls Shrink will open in the UK in Sept.
kevinspacey,@monamiia Thank you very much for the birthday wishes
kevinspacey,"@holtlt Its going to Toronto Film Fest & opens in October, I'm told."
kevinspacey,@MarkoMentor Nothing to do with likes or dislikes. Has to do with not wanting be DM by lots of people. Enjoy public forum so won't follow.
kevinspacey,@AlbertRem68 Hello to my Belgian followers. I was told you might all appreciate a shout out.
kevinspacey,"SHRINK not studio film, no PR budget or big ads, very few know about it. A little film on few screens in few cities. Doing my best to help."
kevinspacey,@tatianazippora That was a remarkably kind and wonderful thing to share. Means a great deal to hear that. Thank you very much.
kevinspacey,"@eddiEvans Once upon a time my Tweets 'cracked' you up & now I'm marketing. 1 thing I have learned, can't please everyone - all the time."
kevinspacey,"@jeffpulver Thanks for the invite, but I will be on stage in London doing Inherit the Wind; so won't be able to participate. Hope goes well"
kevinspacey,@babyhuggables Its a movie.
kevinspacey,"@Jenniceg In all the major cities; Miami, Ft Lau, etc."
kevinspacey,@joekingispretty That was very funny.
kevinspacey,@pats4real SHRINK is on what is called platform release. Goes out slowly across the country. Widening as the weeks go by.
kevinspacey,@SeuMin Congrats. Adopt a puppy from a good place; so many dogs need homes. Good for you!
kevinspacey,"I'm told that SHRINK will open this Friday in Florida, as well as the other cities I Tweeted about earlier today."
kevinspacey,@byondc No plans to record any album soon. But perhaps someday. I enjoy singing & don't get the chance as much as I would like.
kevinspacey,@that1guynick SHRINK is already playing in LA and NY. Started there last Friday. Expanding this Fri to afore mentioned cities.
kevinspacey,"SHRINK opens Fri in Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Houston, Minneapolis, Phili, San Diego, Seattle, SF, DC. Hope fans will go!"
kevinspacey,@mayclem72 Shrink will open in the UK in the fall. Don't have exact dates yet.
kevinspacey,"SHRINK opens on Fri in Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Houston, Minneapolis, Phili, San Diego, Seattle, SF, DC. Hope fans go see!"
kevinspacey,@kezzamcfezza It might be best not to ask questions that could be a spoiler for those who haven't seen the film yet.
kevinspacey,"SHRINK playing in NY today at the Landmark Sunshine on E. Houston, for those asking."
kevinspacey,Thanks to all for the B-Day wishes. 9 friends flew into New Orleans & surprised me last night at dinner. Such a happy time/smile still here

kevinspacey,@Annushka_G_F I very much enjoyed Moscow & hope to return one day with a play. The people I met were very nice.
kevinspacey,@ianaries I will not be Tweeting about the 24 Hour Plays but @24HourPlays will be for all 24 hours.

kevinspacey,"@webeecho Any film that is made independently, outside studio 
financing/without distributor/no matter of budget is considered independent"
kevinspacey,"Britons, I just wanted to remind you that the slick, little, indie film MOON that I had some part of, goes theatrical as of tomorrow in UK"
kevinspacey,@ikelovesme Really was.
kevinspacey,@SillyPutty4 That was better than having everyone mad at me for saying I was in it & them finding out after paying for the film
kevinspacey,I was joking w/ @JohnStamos cause he is a pal. I guess some think everything is meant seriously here. Lets not lose our sense of humor kids
kevinspacey,@JohnStamos Why can't I find you when I search for you here? Have you already screwed up and blocked yourself?
kevinspacey,Accidental Billionaires by @BenMezrich now on sale! @DanaBrunetti & I are producing the film Adaptation. http://bit.ly/buyAB Please RT
kevinspacey,@bgl2010 Maybe that's because he is a fictional character.
kevinspacey,@arousebroadway is interviewing me RE: The Norman Conquests. Follow and @arousebroadway your questions
kevinspacey,@dmsKevieBear I feel a block coming on . . .
kevinspacey,@Gharrett I know. And yet I keep reading that I've 'retired' from films. Go figure.
kevinspacey,"@Graycii Sci-Fi Independent film. Or in your case, Sci-Fi Indie-Dim"
kevinspacey,"@Lilsirene No, I am not directing FOI. Trent Cooper is and we're having a blast. I'm producing w/@DanaBrunetti"
kevinspacey,@KathleenMackey Happy Birthday and enjoy many days to come!
kevinspacey,@AdamLeiphart Back onstage at Old Vic in Sept in Inherit the Wind. Trevor Nunn directs. Plays through Dec 20th.
kevinspacey,"@JenetDechary We chose to shoot FOI in New Orleans exactly to bring jobs, etc here. Having a great time. Fantastic city. People should visit"
kevinspacey,@AdamLeiphart Thanks. Very kind of you to say.
kevinspacey,@xvampirax Happy 20th. Hope this is just one of many great days ahead. Smiles & rock on!
kevinspacey,"To my US followers, sci-fi indie film MOON opens wide this Friday. Sam Rockwell is great. I'm sort of in it & I think its a darn good film"
kevinspacey,Start of 3rd wk of shooting on Father of Invention. Scenes with Red West. He was on Baa Baa Black Sheep w/Robert Conrad. He's been good.
kevinspacey,Near end of 1st wk. Hotter than hell. So hot Mini had to get haircut. Heather Graham is fun. Lots work done but looking forward to weekend.
kevinspacey,Hello all. About to shoot 1st scene for Father of Invention. Looking forward to same rhythm in shooting as we had on Casino Jack. Went fast
kevinspacey,"@McFreeman1 And we had a great meal. Staff, waiters & especially chef welcomed us in grand style. Thanks to them."
kevinspacey,"@MrMikeLawson Manager was very nice so didn't feel 'turned away'. Some places can't have dogs, though they should be allowed everywhere!"
kevinspacey,"@MarthaChristian Very kind of you to say so. Our crew were great, professional and we had lots of laughs. Thanks."
kevinspacey,Jeff Goldblum is alive and well. I just spoke to his manager. Stop these stupid rumors.
kevinspacey,Been going non-stop since wrapping Casino Jack. Rhode Island for Pell & now New Orleans for Father of Invention. No time to Tweet. All good!
kevinspacey,@dmsKevieBear I would appreciate not being reminded everyday. Unless your are a mean bear.
kevinspacey,"For those asking, it is not true I am considering a contest reality TV show about the Old Vic."
kevinspacey,"@bgl2010 Interpreted answer that TV networks have approached Old Vic about fly on the wall docs, but always have said no. So not true"
kevinspacey,"Pell Awards, elegant & well done nite. Gave speech on arts & Senator Pell. His widow couldn't have been more generous. Was at their home."
kevinspacey,Casino Jack not released until next year. Headed to Rhode Island to receive the Pell Award. Then to New Orleans to shoot Father of Invention
kevinspacey,"I am wrapped on Casino Jack. Great Canadian crew, awesome co-stars, good story & a fantastic experience. Thanks Toronto!"
kevinspacey,"My goodness, just realized that overnight reached over 500,000 followers. Simply amazed. Thanks for staying tuned. Last day on Casino Jack"
kevinspacey,"@NataliaCi I believe he also plays one of the butlers in Sullivan's Travels, which is a great film by Preston Sturges."
kevinspacey,"@lizpa26 Well, lucky for me that makeup only takes half hour. Only takes hours if you're wearing a different face. Alas I'm stuck w/mine"
kevinspacey,@TxZodiac Could be because I have nothing to do with anything w/the info on IMDB. So the lesson is don't believe everything you read.
kevinspacey,"@DaveGOwen Pam Ferris, Ralf Little, James Cordon, etc, are all accomplished theatre actors, as well as having done TV. Was great fun."
kevinspacey,Been a long day. Worked early & until very late. Crashing as I have a very early call time in the AM. Hope you all had a good day. Peace out
kevinspacey,"@AustinMassey Well, while I'm flattered, tell her to hit the books. That would be my advice."
kevinspacey,@eddiEvans I'm afraid that Professorship came to its end a few weeks ago.
kevinspacey,@zenithview Welsh & Swedish. Not Irish.
kevinspacey,@that1guynick thanks. Also The Ref happens to be the last film I shot in Toronto.
kevinspacey,@HeidisCyberSpac Sorry I missed your class. But I was busy with some other stuff.
kevinspacey,@kentlam I thought Winter Garden was very unique & great space. Also Duke of York's.
kevinspacey,@TxZodiac I can't think of anything that would have made me do Criminal Minds. Must have been someone who looks like me - unrecognizably
kevinspacey,@rtlechow Must be another film. We've been in Hamilton. Only shot about 3 days in Toronto proper.
kevinspacey,@blissontap He just sang it to me in the car. Hilarious. He should have a series!
kevinspacey,Back shooting today. Scenes w/Kelly P & Jon Lovitz. Can't believe its winding down so fast. Here 5 wks & its gone quick. On to next soon.
kevinspacey,@MotionActor It was. I think every city should have one.
kevinspacey,@RandyUlene I did and the Winter Garden upstairs. Quite spectacular.
kevinspacey,@riadub I attended a very nice dinner with Gordon Pinsent just last night. It was great to see him again.
kevinspacey,"Off today. Took tour of some of the theater's here in Toronto. Great old building w/good stages. Soulpepper Theatre too, who do great work"
kevinspacey,"@NataliaCi No, that is not true."
kevinspacey,Snapper = paparazzi. Yes
kevinspacey,"A-hole snapper hit crew guy w/camera, so Ontario police had him thrown off set yesterday."
kevinspacey,Hey all; today is last day to enter to win $50K for the Stella Artois Short Film Project  http://tinyurl.com/sasfp
kevinspacey,"Mini is a mix, a bit of Jack Russell, terrier, mongrel. And McCain is himself in real footage of the Senate Hearing."
kevinspacey,"Morning all. Filming Senate Hearing today where McCain grilled Abramoff. Beautiful day. Took Mini to WoofStock early, street fair for dogs:)"
kevinspacey,@balapa We should have more people like you who dedicate themselves to helping educate & improve the lives of the next generation. Congrats.
kevinspacey,@mitchthemonster If I told what piece I played then where would the surprise be when you see the film? Best not to reveal all.
kevinspacey,@guille171170 No. We are shooting in Toronto. Just a slang term of affection.
kevinspacey,"@zizzybiz Jack Abramoff, the character I'm playing. My previous TimeLine has all info on this film."
kevinspacey,"@jpbedard Been working almost everyday, haven't had much time on the streets. But people have been very nice. Our Canadian crew is awesome"
kevinspacey,"Off to the movie factory again. Scenes to look like we are in DC. Last night did Chopin piano piece in a scene w/Kelly P, cause Jack played."
kevinspacey,@amore_eterno Big Kahuna was 16 days of shooting. So it was kinda like doing a play w/camera's. It went fast & both DeVito & Facinelli great
kevinspacey,"@Badwisdom My mother raised me right & I never speak ill of anyone publicly. Must have the guts to tell them to their face, not elsewhere."
kevinspacey,@ALAPA_ON_ELLEN Hello to all you guys. And my best to your wonderful teacher. Shot Pay It Forward in Vegas but not coming there soon. Smiles
kevinspacey,@tisjustme Casino Jack isn't really about casino's. That was Jack Abramoff's nick name in DC. Represented Indian Casino's on Capitol Hill
kevinspacey,@Sydney_C_Wu Math!
kevinspacey,Back on Casino Jack again today. First day of work for Kelly Preston who is a delight. Worked last few days w/Jon Lovitz - very funny & good
kevinspacey,@mermaidkd I have never been on FaceBook and nor have I followed or read any of these pages.
kevinspacey,"@Francesca1000 It was never 1 went I auditioned. It was a panel. And yes, I believe it should be more than 1 person making that decision."
kevinspacey,@lachance680 Go to oldvictheatre.com to find answers to your questions. We just announced our sixth season.
kevinspacey,@Vivaldi4 Truth is I could curl up on a food tray & sleep soundly. Before I ever flew 1st class I did that many times.
kevinspacey,"@jaw467 Well, its not like you won't know where I am."
kevinspacey,"@liliamar Well, its really random & not a system I've carved out. Just when I have time & something seems interesting to reply too."
kevinspacey,"@enovyresom I do not speak German. Although was sometimes tempted to invent a slang version of German, which involves a very heavy accent"
kevinspacey,@WillSteve Never tempted to reprise Usual Suspects. Some things shouldn't be attempted & in my opinion that would be one of them.
kevinspacey,@Lkue  Wishing you a very happy 21st Birthday! Hope you have a great one.
kevinspacey,"@KMB87 Yes. Tennis, biking, jogging, squash - enjoying the city & jazz, etc. Oh & occasionally sleep."
kevinspacey,"@Hannah_Barnes13 If you go to my TimeLine, I have answered all previously. Casino Jack about Jack Abramoff, Washington lobbyist"
kevinspacey,"@LatissaH Preview are cheaper & give production a chance to work out the performances, etc before critics see it."
kevinspacey,"@shapirophoto As a producer on a film, I see all the footage that is shot & am involved in editing. If just an actor, then not."
kevinspacey,Done in makeup. Heading to set to start another scene. Feeling rested after 7 hours sleep on flight. Bridge Project got fantastic reviews!
kevinspacey,@ispep01 That was a great trip. Kenn Harper was kind to @DanaBrunetti and I. Beautiful scenery & very nice people. Polar Man was hilarious!
kevinspacey,"@jarteaga That would have been Ruth Meyers, the costume designer for LA Confidential."
kevinspacey,"Crazy days. NY for Norman, UK for Old Vic opening night yesterday for both Sam Mendes directed plays, party, speeches. Now back in Toronto."
kevinspacey,"@tuckerpowers There were times when it was tough, never gave up hope & just put blinders on & kept running. Everyone's path is their own."
kevinspacey,@AlexBird14 thanks. We are very happy today. Back for more filming in Toronto in a few days. Where you singing next?
kevinspacey,@stephenfry And you gave excellent remarks during the Q & A. Thanks for speaking so eloquently about arts funding. I think we did good!
kevinspacey,So delighted to hear that we won Best Revival Tony Award last night for Norman Conquests. Congrats to all involved. Back in London w/smiles!
kevinspacey,"@willieseamen Its so easy to stop following me. Then you won't have to complain. Many others enjoy my banter. If you don't, then block me."
kevinspacey,So had a great drinks session with Norman Conquests cast & did 10 mins on red carpet. Off to London now & wish them all well. Go Old Vic!
kevinspacey,Done with Filip & Frederick. Didn't understand anything but was fun. Now off to have celebration drinks w/Norman Conquests cast. Rock on!
kevinspacey,@LatissaH That might be unfair to the person replacing me on the Tony's. So mums the word.
kevinspacey,I'm on a Swedish talk show today called Filip & Fredrik live from NY at 3PM. For my Swedish fans. Sorry to all who aren't able to watch.
kevinspacey,"Happy Tony Awards Sunday. Wishing the company of Norman Conquests a memorable & exciting night. No matter what, you are all winners to me!"
kevinspacey,@LinDzWo I think there is already enough anger in this world and not enough kindness & professionalism. You'll have to learn to put up w/it.
kevinspacey,"@thoward2009 I won Best Supporting Actor Tony for Lost In Yonkers by Neil Simon back in 92. Play won for Best Play, Actress, Supp Actress."
kevinspacey,@pinktank1 The Tony Awards are the theatre equivalent to the Oscars. Honoring plays & musicals for this past season on Broadway.
kevinspacey,"@nataliewalker84 No, it has been turned back into a proscenium theatre for current Sam Mendes productions & for next season."
kevinspacey,"@bgl2010 No, I head right into shooting next film, Father of Invention. No rest for the weary."
kevinspacey,This is because of a conflict with things I have to do in London and nothing to do with the Tony Awards. I would be there if I could.
kevinspacey,"@cristinaelisse Start one in a few weeks, called Father of Invention."
kevinspacey,"@somethingmania Some but not all of our student seats are good seats. First come, first served. Theatre feels intimate though, so all good."
kevinspacey,"Because of a conflict, have pulled out of doing Tony's. Best to all in Norman Conquests company. Wish I could be there. Go team Old Vic!"
kevinspacey,@danbrusca Awesome. Very cool to take the time to organize that. Rock on Old Vic @OldVicFans
kevinspacey,@KingTwizzy Its easy. You go to my page and block me.
kevinspacey,"Been shooting all day on tarmac & in jet for scenes for Casino Jack. Crowed in there with camera's, lights, crew & actors. Pretending to fly"
kevinspacey,@TCable2105 The most remarkable and unique talent to grace our screens & stages. Also a big supporter of Old Vic & seen many of our plays.
kevinspacey,@ce77 Happy Friday back.
kevinspacey,@LatissaH that scene was written and invented. And I don't do Mr. Magoo.
kevinspacey,@Aries419 August Wilson was remarkable playwright & would be worthy. But you can understand why I'm rooting for Norman Conquests!
kevinspacey,"@Kellswalter Not ignoring, but hard to follow all the Tweets & answer. Did you ask something?"
kevinspacey,"@KimCattrall Yes I am attending and presenting. Although it would also be nice to accept one, as we are up for Best Revival."
kevinspacey,@jsphcrft It is sublime & we are so honored to have all those great actors on the Old Vic stage. Looking forward to opening night!
kevinspacey,@KimCattrall Great news for the playwrights & productions. CBS done the right thing! Took a bit of arguing. Great for Broadway community!
kevinspacey,@somechristine Because its a 10 year plan and we will have just finished our 5th Season of work.
kevinspacey,Great news theatre lovers. Got official word that the Tony Awards have reconsidered and Best Play Revival will now be on the telecast on CBS
kevinspacey,@pirajiba Go to www.oldvictheatre.com to see entire schedule for Inherit the Wind performances.

kevinspacey,Here is the link for the Evening Standard article in London of Old Vic Season Six announcement:  http://tinyurl.com/ougrfc
kevinspacey,@bgl2010 Yes. Most AD have stayed in the position for a decade. Would take that long to establish company as we were starting from scratch.
kevinspacey,@Francesca1000 Yes. And yes.
kevinspacey,@892300 @TriggerStreet is sponsored by Stella Atois. @DanaBrunetti & I founded it 8 years ago.
kevinspacey,"@Phantasie If you Google Old Vic Theatre and then click Images, you can find lots of pictures, designs, etc."
kevinspacey,"@Willowmoon1 that meant 1st play of the season, not my 1st play. I have been doing plays since I was 11."
kevinspacey,@playgirlc We have students seats for those under 25 at 12 pounds. For every perf of any play we do. Have since we started 5 seasons ago.
kevinspacey,@marygrace0406 The cast of Norman Conquests are the best. So proud of them. Fingers crossed for them Sunday at Tony Awards!
kevinspacey,Look for Old Vic Season Six announcement tomorrow. Very excited about entering our 2nd phase of 10 year plan. Will act on stage in 1st play.
kevinspacey,@rickwine We didn't see Niagara. We were shooting on a golf course about half hour away & were filming all day until the sun dropped
kevinspacey,"@MsZenitram No. I'm doing a film about Jack Abramoff, who played some golf. He was a Washington lobbyist. My previous TimeLine tells info"
kevinspacey,"@88state  Do not read comments anywhere on the web but look at reviews, only for films - as they are done. Never plays, till after finished"
kevinspacey,"@serachan I don't play golf. Was just doing it for two days, so I have no favorite courses. But I could take it up, was good fun."
kevinspacey,"@RakishlyAutumn Not true. Mini has an S cape but it was bought at a store, not made. And I don't have anything from Fred Claus."
kevinspacey,@LatissaH Quoted correct. Hope they change their minds at Tony's cause should be about honoring this years work not musicals from 4 yrs ago
kevinspacey,"Spent last two days on golf courses. Yesterday practice, today filming. Hopefully I will end up looking like I can play the game!"
kevinspacey,@SecondNatureTC The choices of assistant directors are made by the director of particular plays. Not a full time position but changes w/each
kevinspacey,@amosbkln Hold out hope that the Tony's will reconsider this decision and broadcast Best Revival of a Play. They have few days to make good.
kevinspacey,@ImAuntDee I got to be on Johnny Carson to promote the Fall From Grace film. I even got to be the punch line in his monologue.
kevinspacey,@mindrew2 She is named after the car. Mini is the spelling. Not the mouse.
kevinspacey,"@Sweetcline Sorry, seemed to have gone out wrong. Happy B-Day Caroline. Hope its a good one!"
kevinspacey,@burghsportsfan Happy Birthday Lauren! Hope you have a lovely day.
kevinspacey,"@JoJo059 Yes, indeed it is. And there I am standing at my table telling a story about Jack Lemmon. He's sitting at his table few feet away."
kevinspacey,"@AlexBird14 Small world. If she's on set maybe I will meet her. If not, tell her thanks."
kevinspacey,"@ddpianoman Have dedicated my life to acting, directing, etc. I can't imagine not enjoying it. Very lucky as the journey is awesome!"
kevinspacey,@LatissaH We have been stuck shooting inside buildings most of past week. Golf scenes yet to come.
kevinspacey,@CameronRawson I've lived in London the past 6/half years.
kevinspacey,"@bgl2010 I spoke, as 4 or 5 others did from tables. Didn't go on stage, but was part of the program. Fairly certain DVD of event has all."

kevinspacey,"@LuciaButnariu I have directed several plays, including a few months ago w/Richard Dreyfuss in Complicit at Old Vic."

kevinspacey,@lacoles Follow @TriggerStreet
kevinspacey,@HunterPitkin Happy Birthday to you.
kevinspacey,@LuciaButnariu Think long term. Opportunity to meet creative team. Might not get part but that's less important that a lasting impression
kevinspacey,"Hey, sorry there have not been many tweets last couple of days, but we have been shooting in places without signal. When we move, game on."
kevinspacey,"@CMISmith We consider all kinds of plays, including Renaissance works. Haven't found right 1 w/right cast, etc. But always considering."
kevinspacey,@japaan Ciao. Hope you feel better as the day goes forward. Tomorrow is another day. Keep solid.

kevinspacey,@Tradertoms I ask nicely if its possible to have a tennis table but it is not in my contract. Hate to burst the urban legend.

kevinspacey,@JULIE_MOORE Hello. Hope you're having a good day.

kevinspacey,@JennyR2005 An advance schedule prior to shooting that usually stays as it is. Based on locations & actors availabilities. So we know early.

kevinspacey,"@dsilver829 Abramoff consulted on this film, although can't benefit financially. The discussion is about stalking not gossip or digging."

kevinspacey,@mksheffer Monday nights at Village Vanguard. Their Big Band are awesome! 7th Avenue just below 14th Street.
kevinspacey,"Like to add my voice w/@aplusk & @robluketic if Twitter endorsed TV show stalking a well known person, I too would disappear from Twitter."
kevinspacey,"@Alexw373 I couldn't possibly reply to all Tweets. Like with everything in this life, I make my own choices."
kevinspacey,@Rosiecosy that was for her as you are the messenger. Send it on.
kevinspacey,@Rosiecosy Tweeting to say keep your smile on. It can't be such a bad day. Somewhere the sun is shinning & it will get to you too.
kevinspacey,@LatissaH I believe hundreds vote for Tony's from theatre community.
kevinspacey,"@dan730 A few. But usually don't meet actors until their 1st day of filming. Unless there are rehearsals, which is rare"
kevinspacey,@veganchic I'm not sure what he's shooting. But I will try to find out.
kevinspacey,@JaredShipley I must admit I don't. But that was a long time ago. But we had an awesome crew on that film.
kevinspacey,"@MommaRap I don't spend that much time in Los Angeles, so I doubt its in the cards. Certainly not this year. But he's a very funny person."
kevinspacey,@bgl2010 I didn't produce Telstar so am not involved in its sales. I suppose they'd want it too but I have no information.
kevinspacey,@RaptureHL Amazing likeness of both Dana & I. That should be hanging in the museum next to the portrait of Mini & me from yesterday! Ha!
kevinspacey,Rob Lowe surprised me with a set visit today. Shooting a film a few blocks from us. Known him since h/wife did makeup on GlenGarry.
kevinspacey,"BIrthday dinner for director, George Hickenlooper tonight. Tore office up for all of you in today's scene. Broke phone & a light! Goodnight!"
kevinspacey,@Maumekim Can verify this is me from looking at my TimeLine. I wouldn't have someone do Twitter any more than I'd have them answer my mail
kevinspacey,@detectivepunk The quarantine ended many years ago. Now all you need is health certificate for dog & you can take them in & out of country.
kevinspacey,@koranp23 AFI. American Film Insititue. They give out a Life Time Achievement Award every year to an entertainer.
kevinspacey,@bgl2010 I was very lucky to have been asked to speak about Jack at the AFI event & was there to watch his speech. A memory I hold dear.
kevinspacey,@amentor Welcome to Twitter & thanks for the kind words.
kevinspacey,Just finished lunch break. Been a good day. Done 3 scenes with office hysterics for last of the day. Thanks for keeping tuned. More later.
kevinspacey,@Martina007 That is hilarious. Mini is very pleased at the sheer size of this portrait. Where is it hanging then? London/NY/Reno? Thanks!
kevinspacey,@valleyer Good Lord no. I'm just making a couple of films for a few months. Vic will continue next 5 years - at least.
kevinspacey,"@TheGriper I'm not sensitive about what you wrote, was simply suggesting you don't have to read my Tweets. Why bother to follow?"
kevinspacey,"@TheGriper If you don't like my Tweets & see them as self serving, then stop following me. I'm keeping in touch w/those who enjoy them."
kevinspacey,@Coolmax1966 Go to my TimeLine to see previous Tweets about project.
kevinspacey,"@yansor No. I threw office items at my assistant, but didn't destroy the office."
kevinspacey,Back in the make up chair. Gorgeous day. On set in a while. I get to go crazy today & destroy my office. Hope I don't hurt myself. Later
kevinspacey,@actor413 Film called Casino Jack. Go to my Timeline & you can read previous Tweets about it.
kevinspacey,"Glad you enjoyed Tweets from today. Tomorrow I will have less time, as we have many big scenes. Thanks for keeping tuned in. Signing off."
kevinspacey,"@Carlo_Sostilio Up to 7/8 scenes a day, given time at each location. Shoot scenes in movie at that location or set & move. Actors know lines"
kevinspacey,@AlexBird14 Class will stay alive as long as you keep wearing suits! Glad you discovered BD. He was perhaps the best nightclub entertainer!
kevinspacey,@Jes_Carman_Wade Go to my TimeLine to see previous comments on this
kevinspacey,"@jensanut6674 Don't announce Season Six until June. Bridge Project closes Aug 15th, but new season begins early Sept. See  oldvictheatre.com"
kevinspacey,@sagarraha Did as many as 7 musicals in high school. I never had a fear of singing. Grew up listening to the greats & tried to imitate.
kevinspacey,@Tan_zanite That's where we were today. But 40 min drive is not 'around' Toronto? Like filming in NJ isn't 'around' NY.
kevinspacey,@Chaply Sorry I have nothing to do w/ hiring extra's. Can't agree to you saying I'd sent you. Everyone on Twitter could show up saying same
kevinspacey,"@AlexBird14 Thanks for the props on BTS. It was a great experience, especially recording all those fantastic songs."
kevinspacey,@EmilyMiller_DC Its clear he brought himself down. Extensively spoke to all involved in Abramoff's business. That's the focus of the film.
kevinspacey,@Martina007 Mini is always with me for long periods when I am away from London. She's fine & very happy!
kevinspacey,"@EmilyMiller_DC Didn't write it, not directing it. Yours is a minor character & if you have concerns you can always express those to George"
kevinspacey,@danavshelley No. The interiors are shot in Toronto & exteriors in DC.
kevinspacey,"@IsabelleTweets Casting goes right into filming,  as actors work different days. Media will write an actor is cast who was just in talks."
kevinspacey,"@EmilyMiller_DC Well, I have nothing to do with clearances & such but a great deal of the story is public domain, I would guess."
kevinspacey,@johnwestby Not major. He wore the hat once. It was raining/grabbed the 1st one handy. Also always wore hats to cover his Yarmulke in public
kevinspacey,"@EmilyMiller_DC Can't account for what he might have said to you, it doesn't exist in the script. Film is about before he went to prison"
kevinspacey,@chrisvanbuskirk Won't be sending any pics. Sorry my phone isn't set up for that.
kevinspacey,@mazzieemoo nope. Just quick replys to as many people as I can.
kevinspacey,"@enigma4221 How would I know. To each his own, as they say."
kevinspacey,@enigma4221 most of my Tweets are written w/ a sense of humor. Sometimes people  mistake irony for something else. Ha!
kevinspacey,@enigma4221 I answer the questions I want to. And try not to judge Twitter community.
kevinspacey,@klj22 Never said that when I was with him. Don't know where that story came from. Don't believe every report out there as factual.
kevinspacey,@enigma4221 what are you my acting coach?
kevinspacey,@enigma4221 Have always kept myself busy on sets. Twitter is no distraction. I don't Tweet when doing more than walking a hall for scene.
kevinspacey,"@enigma4221 one thing to know about films, a lot of time is waiting for lighting, moving equipment, etc. Lucky if film 15 mins entire day"
kevinspacey,"@TattooLost Moon w/Sam Rockwell - Telstar, directed by Nick Moran - Men Who Stare at Goats w/Clooney - Shrink w/Robin Williams."
kevinspacey,"@LatissaH Gave most money away to charities. This is 1 reason he is such a complex person. Wasn't buying mansions, cars. $ he made he gave"
kevinspacey,@tiffanyleigh Schedule has been worked to allow me to go for other important events through next five weeks. Sometimes we have diff days off
kevinspacey,@angiedearest Usually don't  believe anyone is cast for a film until I actually see them on the set. Things change so fast in the film world
kevinspacey,@NancyK0323 maybe 5/6. But depends. Sometimes dinner scenes takes days just to film around the entire table. Always different.
kevinspacey,"@KathleenMackey Ah, I'm not a method actor. I can switch it on & off. And at end of day I hang up the charcter with the costumes."
kevinspacey,1st scene done already. Now changed into another suit & about to film a walk into Abramoff office f/ beginning of film. No words for this
kevinspacey,@LatissaH bit difficult to follow Shuttle while filming. So will catch it later on the box.
kevinspacey,"@tessholland Lots & lots of makeup. Don't have that much to work with, so they build me from the ground up early in the morning. Ha!"
kevinspacey,"@TrulyJamesNeil Well, one is finished & one is just beginning. But think comparisons are not that helpful when looking at apples & oranges."
kevinspacey,@AlexBird14 About time they did a feature about Sinatra. Such an amazing life & phenomenal talent. Hope they cast it with a great actor.
kevinspacey,@pugdogsrule Check my TimeLine. Answered all about film before.
kevinspacey,@snakeater99 I will next be starting a film called Father of Invention. A comedy w/a nice father/daughter story at center.
kevinspacey,"@pixi3dust Well, it is long hours but there are millions of people who have real difficult/hard jobs. I would call acting hard. Its a joy."
kevinspacey,@dplante23 can't give out locations.
kevinspacey,"@TheCFiles Depends on length of scene, number of different camera angles & actors involved. No average time. However long it takes for each"
kevinspacey,@JaniceMalcolm check my TimeLine. Answered all about film before.
kevinspacey,"For those asking Casino Jack is shooting in & around Toronto & Washington, DC."
kevinspacey,@AlexBird14 very brave to have sung without music for the ballad. Nice. You are talented.
kevinspacey,@jessicaraydrake perhaps opposite of further damage & reform can begin. Like w/Recount & elections maybe it will show what needs to change
kevinspacey,@RVPaul yes. TS is producing.
kevinspacey,@daytripper2 go to my timeline as I answered this many times.
kevinspacey,"@djprestonwaters Does that matter? Millions go to movies about fictional people. Why wouldn't they if its a compelling story, well presented"
kevinspacey,"@NPileggi No scenes in Vegas. Not about gambling, except for Abramoff's dealings with his Indian casino clients . About lobbyists in DC."
kevinspacey,@ohmycodbkk66 I am in Goats. We shot it last year.
kevinspacey,Dressed in a suit & going to start shooting now. Costumes are good & everyone on set is very nice. Good vibe & easy environment. Smiles.
kevinspacey,"@MarkSedney George Hickenlooper, who did doc on Apocalypse Now, Heart of Darkness & film Factory Girl w/Sienna Miller"
kevinspacey,"Day two begins. Just out of make-up & soon heading to the set. Have 5 scenes to shoot, in replica offices of law firm Abramoff worked for."
kevinspacey,@NancyK0323 I'm not counting. Just trying to occasionally keep up and respond to as many as I can.
kevinspacey,"@AlexBird14 Trust me, theatre has kept me alive, not the other way around. Just doing my bit. Be at Vic another 5/6 yrs."
kevinspacey,@AlexBird14 Nice work. Good singer & you held that audience well. Was that a high school group? Seemed very unruly but you held your own.
kevinspacey,@davidcooper18 A few months time - although I will be back for important events at theatre. No matter where I am I still run the Old Vic.
kevinspacey,"@chrisvanbuskirk Not yet, but it shall be making an appearance."
kevinspacey,@KaylaMurphy3 Do not know what you are going on about. No idea what you could have wrote that makes you think I would block you. All good.
kevinspacey,@mermaidkd It was our 1st day of shooting & you are asking about the premiere? At least a year away & I won't decide that question.
kevinspacey,"@sagarraha Hello India! Sure it would been a character in a play, but its hard to pick a single experience out. All different challenges"
kevinspacey,@busybeeblogger No. Two entirely different personalities - despite the similarity in duplicity.
kevinspacey,"@karlomarc I have nothing to do with any site except Twitter and TriggerStreet.com. Anything else is nothing I am involved, so can't answer"
kevinspacey,@RackedTheatre Awesome. Great taking the opportunity to start your own company. Good luck & let me know what is coming. Your 1st title LOL.
kevinspacey,@ralfrottmann I've just been a little slow but have always responded to fan mail - personally. Before the web there was a thing called mail.
kevinspacey,@Monica1080i Direct messages.
kevinspacey,"@ralfrottmann See? You just proved my point. No thanks on the interview, but I am enjoying the conversations."
kevinspacey,"@IsabelleTweets Ah, that was a joke."
kevinspacey,"@ralfrottmann I am participating, just not with DM. This is a public forum & DM would leave others completely out of the conversation."
kevinspacey,@MerleChloe Yes. I am playing Abramoff.
kevinspacey,@LLGirlBlog It all depends on how success does or does not change a person. As well as what the definition of success is to them personally.
kevinspacey,"@davembrooks Its as much about the lobbying industry in DC as about him. Plus he's a complex, contradictory person & it will be a challenge"
kevinspacey,"It was a good 1st day. We shot a bunch of scenes. Abramoff being arrested, etc & taped voice over as guide for editor. Back early in am."
kevinspacey,@Sarabethmck  Cause I enjoy the public forum of Twitter. If I followed then it will be lots of DM. That would be like giving out my email.
kevinspacey,@kmbrlyn I hope I haven't made my favorite film yet!
kevinspacey,@SupernovaDonna Barry Pepper is playing that role. The reports of Hayden were not correct.
kevinspacey,@tnmoore37 Congrats on graduation!
kevinspacey,"@RenoHype like former Vice President Cheney, I'm in an undisclosed location!"
kevinspacey,Hey; 1st day shooting on Casino Jack. Excited to start/1st scene is in process car in front of a green screen. Will update now & then. Peace
kevinspacey,@NicolaHowson Very funny.
kevinspacey,"@melaniemayron52 Well, long time Ms. Mayron. And its been equally long since I last saw Elana. Nearly a decade, in fact. Hope all is well."
kevinspacey,@Rehanana Did you give it a good shine? Or did you stamp your feet on it? Enjoy the Hollywood!
kevinspacey,@karlomarc I have no idea what you are talking about here. Google? Blocked what? Have not put anybody's password on Twitter. Makes no sense
kevinspacey,"@likemark Ha. Hope to see your film, one of these days. Hope all is good. Thanks for reaching out."
kevinspacey,"@yougivmefever Hope it gets better. Happy, Happy Birthday!"
kevinspacey,@NicolaHowson Hello. Hi.
kevinspacey,@my3suns No cause I don't have to play him now. The film is about before he went to jail.
kevinspacey,@kirstenin Kristen Coalition
kevinspacey,@hismuse This is a movie about to start shooting.
kevinspacey,@amy4669 Wiring a check for money that isn't in the bank. Its called Wire Fraud.
kevinspacey,"Casino Jack is about disgraced Washington lobbyist Jack Abramoff, who is serving a prison sentence currently for wire fraud & other crimes."
kevinspacey,"@Blossomofthefal Catalonia is just being put together & would not film until next year. So its a long, long way off."
kevinspacey,"@kbranch Try to learn two weeks ahead. Films also change, so can only prepare for scenes not being exactly what you learned at the start"
kevinspacey,@ronimom Its funny but with a heart. Enjoyed making it very much. Good director in Jonas Pate.
kevinspacey,@pepecamil Casino Jack about the disgraced Washington lobbyist Jack Abramoff. George Hickenlooper directs/Barry Pepper co-stars.
kevinspacey,"@etnodlew I have to push for Norman Conquests, as its our production from London. At Circle in Square. Also Mary Stuart & God of Carnage."
kevinspacey,@LouHemingway80 Shrink opens July 25th in NY/LA. Fun film w/Robin Williams/Saffron Burrows/Keke Palmer. Play a therapist in Hollywood.
kevinspacey,Hello. Been hunkered down prepping for next film & just no time to Twitter. Appreciate all the comments. Will try to answer some ?'s now.
kevinspacey,"@BimlaProduction Would love too, but he's now on Law & Order, so difficult to schedule. But we loved working together & will try to get him."
kevinspacey,@KaylaMurphy3 um . . . I guess not. But I got this.
kevinspacey,"@fingercuffvids We didn't finance it, but produced it. Too bad Weinstein Company tried to change it & didn't support or know what they had."
kevinspacey,@TonyaJ Its a comedy. And the book its based on has the same title.
kevinspacey,@SaraFeenan Great piece. Thanks for writing it. Our fingers are crossed that we may be able to bring Tunnel 228 back in the fall.
kevinspacey,"@SHAW_CRIPPS I directed Beyond The Sea in 2004. And I will direct again, just not for a while yet."
kevinspacey,@DaveRaveBangkok Became Artistic Director of Old Vic Theatre in London in 03. Full time job. Doing a many films next 2 yrs. I'll be back!
kevinspacey,@Russ_Beer Scott's or J. Sheekey's. Both very good and popular.
kevinspacey,"@SonyaVanSickle Accidental Billionaires by same author of Bringing Down The House (which was made into film 21), by Ben Mezrich."
kevinspacey,@Astro_127 Can you write on a piece of paper Hi Spacey and take a shot of it against window? Would be spaceman saying hi to Spacey in space!
kevinspacey,@LeslieSanchez Didn't know about that page. Memories. Seems long ago when @DanaBrunetti gave me my first Twitter fix. Hope all is good!
kevinspacey,I woke after an amazing sleep to discover that we passed the 300 thou mark. I remain amazed & humbled. You rule! Going for a run w/big heart
kevinspacey,Hope you all are having a good night/day - wherever you are. Enjoyed today's back & forth. Crashing out & sending smiles across the globe!
kevinspacey,@BethBGB I'd have to give it to Buster Keaton. He was remarkable & his physical strength was underestimated. So worth discovering his talent
kevinspacey,"@FaezaMoghul I grew up in LA. I enjoy the place, but prefer to live in NY or London."
kevinspacey,"@jaydon23 and many of them are wrong. Its not about facts its about answering certain ?'s that are current. I will handle, but thanks."
kevinspacey,"@peterdjordjevic Had done 3 things before GGGR. Did a play for a year. Taught me humility, ethics, professionalism & how to be team player"
kevinspacey,@katelynrossi Did I say I was offended? I am allowed to define myself in my own language and I define myself an actor. Not that big a deal.
kevinspacey,@katelynrossi I hope you can see the point I'm making between the profession of acting & a word (celebrity) that has become foul & off base
kevinspacey,@miami8650 Hey Miami. Howdy!
kevinspacey,@Kari_Ward1974 Most of my days are like that when not working. Eat w/friends/tennis/bike ride/chase my dog/ping pong/jazz club. Nice!
kevinspacey,@Justmet37 Its a privilege & blessing to do what I like for a living & have lots of time to get away. The up side far outweighs any down.
kevinspacey,"@Justmet37 Little touchy aren't you. It was a joke, as I've been twittering about not wanting to be called celeb for a while. Take a breath"
kevinspacey,@sheepodoom No thank you. If I choose to do anything on the web it can be taken care of elsewhere. Appreciate the offer.
kevinspacey,@Ginamarie2024 I was unable to attend.
kevinspacey,"@IsJustKelly Well, goo luck to you. I think its the best of all worlds myself."
kevinspacey,@Justmet37 Then go ask Paris Hilton. I'm an actor.
kevinspacey,@IsJustKelly Thanks for that. Malkovich hasn't starred in a play in way too long.
kevinspacey,@ZenZette Not at all. I think its awesome.
kevinspacey,@clanceym None of the hits on Facebook are me. I have had nothing to do with them.
kevinspacey,@auldmags I have nothing to do with that page. Does whoever runs that page answer people as if they are me? Identity theft!
kevinspacey,"@twituyu Yeah, that's not the answer. Too much wrong information in all that stuff. I'll figure it out. Thanks."
kevinspacey,"@PortiaFendeman But I don't want some assistant responding. It's just for the same ?'s, really. Got to be a way of getting standard info out"
kevinspacey,@Janemheller Hi!
kevinspacey,"@gagey Like we wouldn't be considering our man @robluketic? We are a way off from selecting a director, but appreciate your suggestion."
kevinspacey,"I will look into whether I can make a FAQ page, but so far I can't figure if Twitter has one."
kevinspacey,"@TajdarOC Just the ?'s about another SM film/why don't I follow, etc. Don't want people to think I'm rude, but after a while it gets - yawn"
kevinspacey,@sheepodoom I don't have a Facebook page. But thanks for the suggestion.
kevinspacey,"Dear Twitters, as I can't keep answering same ?'s I already answered, feel free to weigh in & help me out & tell new members facts. Thanks"
kevinspacey,@PamelaGlasner In the right circumstances - when its about the work - I have no problem with attention. You have misunderstood my point.
kevinspacey,@K_Rob8 Right.
kevinspacey,"@maddybirbara can't ruin it for people who want to discover film, even though you want the answer. Just have to check it out. Sorry."
kevinspacey,@1uconn I do not think so.
kevinspacey,"@LatissaH None of those. Preparing for a film. Smiling, happy and excited on a good morning, ready to seize the day!"
kevinspacey,"Hey, Norman Conquests won Best Revival, Best Dir & Best Ensemble last night at Drama Desk in NY. Congrats to all at Circle in Sq & Old Vic!"
kevinspacey,"@Patrick7C Okay. How bout a satellite? A telescope? Some space junk? I agree, hope $ go to space program & not just for my selfish reasons."
kevinspacey,@NASA Thanks for the shout out. Talked about your guys Twittering on Leno. Could you name a Shuttle after me? Imagine: Spacey is clear to go
kevinspacey,@Kellswalter Announcing our schedule end of May/early June. At the moment two plays Sam Mendes has directed from May 23rd to Aug 15th.
kevinspacey,"@Kellswalter Not sure what you are referring too, but no worries. I try not to judge on a single twitter. Rock on."
kevinspacey,"@lizpa26 Takes long time. Dealing with schedules of actors, directors, designers & overall season. Not just about the play but much more."
kevinspacey,@bgl2010 Being well known should not turn you into a zoo animal. Some lose courtesy & respect toward a well known person when drinking.
kevinspacey,@KaylaMurphy3 Nope. Never heard of it.
kevinspacey,@tinsherry I'm not on Facebook. Just producing the film of how it began.
kevinspacey,@NicolaWwilts Right. Its a public forum.
kevinspacey,"@eligibleTV Thanks. Mare & I just went back to Chats to film a doc that is following kids for Shakespeare Fest, that we did back then."
kevinspacey,"@Rubinfee yeah, who takes a picture without asking."
kevinspacey,@K_Rob8 No. Everyone sees what everyone tweets & everyone sees my tweets. Nothing is private on Twitter. Unless you choose to follow.
kevinspacey,@ecco1983 No I do not.
kevinspacey,@blogworld Don't agree. Disadvantage in following is anyone could direct message me. Would be like giving email out. Prefer public forum.
kevinspacey,"@jungleboot The paps are nothing next to every idiot in a restaurant, bar or anywhere w/cell phone cameras. I find this more intrusive."
kevinspacey,"Become a fan of this page http://bit.ly/abbmdb It's @benmezrich's next  
book. @danabrunetti & I are producing the film adaptation w/ Sony"
kevinspacey,@dragonmethos There is no DVD. It was taped for Lincoln Center Library in NYC. Viewed for research purposes only. Never can be broadcast.
kevinspacey,"@Azaid Yes, I really was a shoe salesman in the Northridge Mall in the San Fernando Valley in sunny LA during high school summers."
kevinspacey,@cdmetruk If its not a completely strange ? then I try to answer. But way too many are things I've been answering for 10 years. Yawn. Yawn.
kevinspacey,"@GSTess Yeah, well, it comes with the territory. There are more nice ? & that balances it out. Enjoying the banter. But yeah, some are odd."
kevinspacey,@jungleboot I have answered this ? so many times in the last month. I know nothing. Don't even know if they are making it. Sorry. Clueless.
kevinspacey,"@vulcanqueen Its easy to love where you live if you love what you're doing, which I do. I don't live in LA, just work there. Always NYC."
kevinspacey,"@JohnManthorpe Well, it will be obvious that you are standing taller than they are right now."
kevinspacey,@CatherineCrook I do not know but I would think sometime in the fall.
kevinspacey,@dma1122 Thanks to LT Col Ahrens and all in Armed Forces who work so hard around the world. We honor your service!
kevinspacey,@nataliewalker84 oh good.
kevinspacey,@Potetoe Shrink opens July 21st in a few cities and then rolls out across country after that.
kevinspacey,@PamelaGlasner sorry to disappoint but I can't play your bad guy. Besides this isn't the place to pitch projects. That's for agents.
kevinspacey,"@MelissaEGilbert I've been on for over a month & when new people join the ? gets asked again and again. This won't stop it, but tanks."
kevinspacey,@nataliewalker84 American citizens cannot be Knighted. And I think one campaign for one thing is enough for one week. Lets not get crazy
kevinspacey,@CampaignSpacey Don't mind people think its good idea but can't be my campaign. Not trying to get H Jackman fired. Host some year w/ be cool
kevinspacey,"I was joking about the host Oscar campaign! Some are taking it serious. Will be too busy training for next Shuttle launch, not available."
kevinspacey,@tdouglas1013 Mug is authentic. Carson signed. Came with pencils. Got at auction. Always such a huge fan of Johnny's. Sits on my desk. Sweet
kevinspacey,Thanks to all for such nice reviews for Carson. Miss him & his hilarious style & brilliance. Loved bringing him behind the desk again!
kevinspacey,@TerriGae Hello!
kevinspacey,"@SabenProt Afraid TS Independent dissolved many years back. There is no new company, only TS Productions & @TriggerStreet"
kevinspacey,"Happy Thursday all. For those who couldn't see Tonight Show with Jay Leno last night, here is where you can:  http://tinyurl.com/73j3am"
kevinspacey,"Thanks to all for the cool congrats on the Leno show. Glad you enjoyed. Some have East Coast feed on West, so have seen it sooner. Smiles"
kevinspacey,@rlmagyar I sent it to everyone. It was an update.
kevinspacey,@Cronyres I get messages from those following me. I don't have to follow to get messages. See? Hi and thanks.
kevinspacey,"@cynicalandbent Since Glengarry was shot in NY, that would seem unlikely. Maybe it was Kevin Bacon & he got me confused. Six degrees!"
kevinspacey,@JulianHiggins The former Cat Stevens & I did a duet last year at a benefit for Old Vic. Sang Simple Song of Freedom. Great to perf w/him
kevinspacey,@Nattjenta I would not make a sequel to any films I have made. Except for Superman. I just like the films I have done  to exist as they are
kevinspacey,"@thehitman29 Afraid I am very behind in the fan mail. I will get a chance when I am back in UK later in the summer. Be patient, I do reply"
kevinspacey,@motlehh Have an awesome night. You rule!
kevinspacey,"@cynicalandbent No. I only lived in LA when I was working on films. Just rented, but never on that street."
kevinspacey,"The Tonight Show With Jay Leno airs tonight at 11:30 local time, across the US."
kevinspacey,"Lets not have any more comments about spelling. It happens. Was sending a tweet, that's the point. A shout out to you all on national TV!"
kevinspacey,"Leno was fun & did impressions. A good time. Wanted to talk  @TriggerStreet short film fest, w/Stella. Here's info  http://tinyurl.com/sasfp"
kevinspacey,I was writing so fast I mispelled ' talking'. But somehow knew the spelling police would let me know. You have not disappointed me.
kevinspacey,Jay and I are taling on the show.
kevinspacey,All dressed and ready. Standing outside next to Jay's old Corvair Chevrolet. Comedy skit on now. I'm next. Or maybe I am the comedy skit!
kevinspacey,Arrived at Tonight Show. Getting ready to tape with Jay Leno in 20 mins! Cat Stevens (now Yusaf) is music guest. Also McCain's mother on.
kevinspacey,"@JennDLock they are, but only a few hours before they air."
kevinspacey,@Sydney_C_Wu Oscar host would be fun. I'd rather do a new musical rather than revival. I did musicals through school. But does BTS count?
kevinspacey,@ProfessorTom That would be the Late Show. Or Late Night. But Tonight Show has taped from California for decades. With Carson then Leno
kevinspacey,@weaverron Hello. Hi. Howdy!
kevinspacey,"@lizpa26 too true. Been having loads of meetings, yesterday and already today. Just not enough hours in the day."
kevinspacey,"@MattBoothman Might be some nominal ticket price, just to pay some costs. But wouldn't be expensive. Its about access."
kevinspacey,@Kawaiisprinkles Believe me we have tried but theatre owner will not budge on helping us get through May.
kevinspacey,"@vocepoco They ask. I try not to do things I don't want, which doesn't make all happy when promoting work, as some invites I can't do."
kevinspacey,Hey. Now in LA and doing the Tonight Show with Leno tonight on NBC. In US at 11:30 PM. I think other can stream on MSNBC later. Smiles.
kevinspacey,@jayseto Happy Big Birthday wishes from the Space.
kevinspacey,@jayseto I should think 7 times saying the same thing would be enough for a response. Now stop it.
kevinspacey,@Sydney_C_Wu Okay. You can stop now. Hello.
kevinspacey,@LatissaH I am not in a position to make the call on SA tour. NC is not touring but continues its run on Broadway into July.
kevinspacey,@jessicabeale Legacy passed on 200. Mini is awesome and keeps us all in hysterics.
kevinspacey,@Comedulce53 Its not that I 'see' anything. I visited his country and met him. For this I'm 'anti American' in some quarters.
kevinspacey,@jinx77 We have done all we can but without concessions from theatre owner we cannot keep going. It is very sad cause its a great show.
kevinspacey,I'm very much better and can't believe how many of you sent good wishes. It's like getting two sacks of get well cards. Honored & thanks!
kevinspacey,"@ranalattimore I'm not suffering from head lice, I just said I wasn't feeling well."
kevinspacey,Finally have collapsed ill today. Might tweet later if feeling better. Past month has been non stop. Not complaining just tired. Later all.
kevinspacey,@CecileLP we hope Bridge will tour to Paris. Don't know yet but working on it. Not this year but perhaps next year.
kevinspacey,@johnwestby perhaps during a stand up but I wouldn't like it in a darkened theatre. You could just tweet later.  That would seem better
kevinspacey,"@bild25 Every few days when someone is new to Twitter or learns I'm here, I'm asked to prove its me. I hope being myself is proof enough"
kevinspacey,@MerleChloe The company is called Bridge Project & Cherry Orchard/Winters Tale are two plays being done.
kevinspacey,@JonCourtney236 hilarious.
kevinspacey,@JUMPINSOUNDS Happy Birthday.
kevinspacey,@reefit Previews begin May 23rd at The Old Vic.
kevinspacey,"@whoopsadaisies yes, family name."
kevinspacey,Just back from last perf of Dancing At Lughnasa at Old Vic. Theatre being configured back to procenium stage for Bridge Project. Great nite!
kevinspacey,Wow. One of the funniest exchanges had on twitter. Put me in an even better mood & I was already flying cause I just played great tennis!
kevinspacey,@jonesyb That is hilarious! Got to figure out how to do that. Very funny.
kevinspacey,"@Hawo0524 Entitled to that opinion, but how is something so valuable to our lives a drain? I laughed since banks are asking for assistance."
kevinspacey,"Funny how some are offended by capitol letters. Didn't imply yelling, just exclaiming a happy day! Didn't realize there are caps police."
kevinspacey,U ALL HAVE A GREAT DAY. I'M OFF TO ENJOY SOME TIME IN THE SUN. HOPE EVERYONE KEEPS SMILING! AND THANKS FOR BEING SO COOL ON TWITTER. PEACE -
kevinspacey,@EmmaPony I saw at Lyric several times. Need to get word out about SA. Tough in West End. Many musicals/more famous. SA deserve to sell out!
kevinspacey,@spaceyfan I do still teach at Oxford.
kevinspacey,"@AnnieWhere Apparently a lot of people. I think its great that people care about what we all share; books, films, theatre, music, art, etc"
kevinspacey,@Ginamarie2024 like Elvis would have said . . . thank you very much!
kevinspacey,"@hashdxb Well, that makes sense since the Old Vic is a block away from Waterloo. Hello again."
kevinspacey,@teemcd I spell like in an American. Don't write the way it ends up in print but newspapers change to be consistent with British spelling.
kevinspacey,I also wrote an opinion piece in todays London Times:  http://tinyurl.com/r2jebn  Those who care about arts funding should pass along. Thxs
kevinspacey,"Nice piece today in Telegraph about Bridge Project, which comes to Old Vic in few weeks:  http://tinyurl.com/q6rcts"
kevinspacey,@3buffalogirls I shall. Thanks for the heads up
kevinspacey,@GabrielleNYC He should write it then. And hopefully he would give the Old Vic first look at it!
kevinspacey,Spring Awakening again last nite. All in London should go. Great & as 1 of producers want them to run long time. Follow at:  @SpringWestEnd
kevinspacey,@turtledudesurf the job title at the Old Vic is Artistic Director.
kevinspacey,"@NicolaWwilts Do not know yet but working on it. We presented it & have been working on it for a year, so yes, I've seen it, many times"
kevinspacey,"@staciejaye Ah, yeah. Who else would be writing updates? Are you really writing yours?"
kevinspacey,"@bgl2010 It doesn't work like that. No one tells any theatre what plays they should do. Its more about educational targets, diverse aud, etc"
kevinspacey,@flutterbyrose Howdy to you all the way over there. Thanks for the kind words.
kevinspacey,@grantsabbath Thanks. Very kind.
kevinspacey,@calkid357 Yep. July. You can get info at www.oldvictheatre.com
kevinspacey,@ozchickie right back at ya. Hope all is good there.
kevinspacey,@CanadianKelli Kelli. Smiles -
kevinspacey,@bgl2010 I don't think you need to stress about it. If you'd ordered 25 tix maybe. I'm sure we will have a load of people lining for returns
kevinspacey,@Sibnosis I think it is late July.
kevinspacey,Hey all. Never expected Tunnel 228 to sell out so fast. Opened last nite & was awesome. We hope to bring back in fall for few months. Thanks
kevinspacey,"@JoJo059 Once it is sold out, tickets can no longer be printed. And you have to order to print."
kevinspacey,Here is article about Tunnel 228 Old Vic/PunchDrunk/Young Vic project from today: http://tinyurl.com/dh77c7
kevinspacey,"For those of you going to www.tunnel-228.com  just need to look a little harder to see where to click. Its performance art, so play along"
kevinspacey,"Hey. New Old Vic perf/installation with PunchDrunk/Young Vic, under Waterloo Station. Now for 15 days. Need tixs but free www.tunnel-228.com"
kevinspacey,@lizpa26 We qualify its just all the money is bespoke. So perhaps when they reassess the next go around we shall be deemed worthy of funds
kevinspacey,@mrclean055 Good luck with your career. Hope college has been valuable for you.
kevinspacey,"@Brooke2775 Ah, no one does it for me. That would be strange. I guess others do or the ? wouldn't be asked."
kevinspacey,@bgl2010 Was always a temporary reconfiguration. Sam Mendes needs epic space so we go back for Winter's Tale/Cherry Orchard
kevinspacey,@Loupy620 No. That was Complicit. This is a British play with the 6 original actors from Old Vic from when it played last fall.
kevinspacey,For all asking to see Brian Dennehy's remarks in giving me Monte Cristo Award in NY go to: http://tinyurl.com/cat8lv  Pics too. He was great
kevinspacey,"Hey everyone, Norman Conquests got 7 Tony Award nominations this morning! Congrats to Old Vic, all on NY side of prod & cast & Matt Warchus"
kevinspacey,@bergmanlevi I will not be in Cannes this year.
kevinspacey,"@neofreestone Glad you enjoyed. Its the last week of performances, as they close Sat night. For all who might want to catch it. Very good."
kevinspacey,@mia59 We are announcing next season's work toward the end of May. No spoilers - sorry.
kevinspacey,"@bgl2010 This is the intention. Won't be announcing that for at least a year. Have year one to finish, which starts at Old Vic end of May"
kevinspacey,@msslynne Yes. I moved to London in the spring of 2003. I live there full time and only go back to US when I'm sneaking in a film.
kevinspacey,Going out to enjoy the day. I made a quick trip to the US. Crazy 24 hours. Hope you all have a happy Sunday!
kevinspacey,@Antonmuzik Yes. Things couldn't be better. Go to oldvictheatre.com for info on all we got going on - in London & on Broadway
kevinspacey,@petertravers Thanks. Fingers crossed for Tuesday. Very proud they have conquered NY!
kevinspacey,@RWFansite An arm of Lions Gate and I believe late June or July.
kevinspacey,@jack_anthony LOL.
kevinspacey,@Markross09 Thanks and welcome to Twitter land.
kevinspacey,"@pesharpe Pretty amazing, huh. But its not quantity, its quality!"
kevinspacey,@jezzabelll thank you much. Very nice.
kevinspacey,@yeah_mate Wow. That's a big assumption. I very much appreciate the people who are following and quite often have nice chats. So there!
kevinspacey,"@danbrusca Awesome. These might be some of the oldest I've seen. People send me programs from their attics , these are in great condition."
kevinspacey,@novalnhernawan I know nothing about a sequel. Wouldn't hold my breath. I'd do it if they wanted but just haven't been told anything.
kevinspacey,@Martina007 that was a story from years ago. Still not true.
kevinspacey,@mcblondieh Very kind. Glad you enjoyed. I had the time of my life!
kevinspacey,@Leskor thanks right back.
kevinspacey,@Leskor a regular nightclub act in Vegas!
kevinspacey,@danbrusca cool. Would like to see those.
kevinspacey,"Not a bad day for travel, which is what I seem to be doing lately. Looking forward to couple of weeks rest. Smiles for a good weekend all!"
kevinspacey,@alicia0384 never been on my space. So must have been a fake.
kevinspacey,Hello all. Few days off. At charity event last nite for Aspinall Foundation. Did spoof of Blind Date. Elle M choose me! All for good cause.
kevinspacey,An amazing two weeks in Manhattan. Norman is best reviewed play on Brwy and I have loved being in NY. Off to new adventures. Later twitters
kevinspacey,@landers23 have a good day/night. And hello to your followers.
kevinspacey,"@teemcd Actual street in Chatsworth, CA. Roy Rogers built a ranch and named the streets. Dale Avenue and Trigger St. Spent time there as kid"
kevinspacey,@JoJo059 thanks. Just found out. And Bridge Project w/Sam Mendes got 4 nominations as well. Go team Old Vic!
kevinspacey,@Boobally I am not. But would someday love to play Sydney in theatre.
kevinspacey,@3buffalogirls not even mildly agitated. Just explaining my reasoning. Its another beautiful day in NY. Who couldn't be happy?
kevinspacey,@Saralaratara no. Its that celebrity is not a profession. Used to mean to celebrate someones work. Now just a label I choose not to adopt.
kevinspacey,@SusanPAus we were at desk and then the control booth changed their mind & moved us to couch. Guess that's why they call it CONTROL booth.
kevinspacey,@KrisAWinchell no actually it is me as I make mistakes in spelling - usually just thumb error - just like everyone.
kevinspacey,@Kiowah because following allows people to direct mess you. And I prefer the public forum. And don't call me a celebrity.
kevinspacey,@3buffalogirls let's not start again with the occasional misspelled word. Its too early in the morning.
kevinspacey,@theatrekind I will try to find out.
kevinspacey,@daftasabat hey we're all getting on a bit. He's great and looks fantastic & doing 8 perf a week in Desire Under the Elms. Could you do that
kevinspacey,@yogurtprincess oh yeah. I think you can find a whole lot of unkind words said about my career all over. Just glad Dennehy didn't use them
kevinspacey,@lauralovsrpattz last time I looked. There are ways to verify. But do I have to prove it to every person who follows? That could get boring
kevinspacey,Brian Dennehy gave a great speech giving award last nite. Was blown away & moved. Wrote the kindess words about my career & was very funny!
kevinspacey,After opening for Norman Conquests I am on Good DayNY in 45 on local Fox TV. If your up and interested. To help box office after reviews!
kevinspacey,Monte Cristo cottage in CT was where Eugene O'Neill was raised & is setting for Long Days Journey Into Night. Given by O'Neill Center.
kevinspacey,NYC is absolutely beautiful today! Spring has sprung!

kevinspacey,"Sleep calls. Back in NY for the Monte Cristo Award tomorrow. Ridiculous weekend of honors, I know. Very nice but a bit overwhelming. Later."
kevinspacey,Apologies for error. Had a sec before the awards start. Didn't mean to come off as a spelling bee loser. Especially about a writing contest!
kevinspacey,Having a great night. Between Buzz Aldrin & Doris Goodwin. He's amazing & very wise  Great that 4 high school kids won writing compitition
kevinspacey,@Martina007 There are many places I get mail. But I'm sure its in a pile somewhere and I try to eventually get through all of it.
kevinspacey,"@EveTChicago Thank you sire. Forsooth, twas not aware Shakespearian talk until thy current tweet. Glad tidings to all who hath partaken!"
kevinspacey,@benedmonds1 well thanks for that.
kevinspacey,@LostMarilyn hello.
kevinspacey,@sukitink I never got a tweet from @aplusk. Or if I did I didn't see it.
kevinspacey,@sukitink not true. So here is a reply just to prove it. I have been having conversations with people for weeks.
kevinspacey,"For those of you who can't follow the thread and are confused, Buzz man is the Astronaut Buzz Aldrin, who is also being honored tonight."
kevinspacey,Was walking to a a place for breakfast. Award is in 4/5 diff areas. I'm getting my for the arts. Excited to meet the great Buzz man.
kevinspacey,@pamrivers no assistant does my twitters or twits. But I suspect a whole lot of people are up than just us 3. As this twit is about to prove
kevinspacey,"Morning all. Its a beautiful day in Wash, DC. Going to Delaware to get Commonwealth Award tonight with Buzz Aldrin, Doris Goodwin. Honored!"
kevinspacey,You can all share opening nite with me. Cameras followed me all nite.  Backstage footage too. Go to;  http://www.nypost.com/video/
kevinspacey,@Pharaohciously Old Vic Theatre. Where I am Artistic Director.

kevinspacey,@jeshakeoma too long to twitter. You can find dozens of definitions in lots of places on web. Prod pulls it all together & puts up money.
kevinspacey,Do you know I produce Spring Awakening in UK outside of OV work. Young cast have started twitter posts during shows. Follow @SpringWestEnd!
kevinspacey,Can all go to NYPost.com to see exclusive backstage footage of  Norman Conquests on Brwy. Followed me through entire nite. Before & after
kevinspacey,Hey everyone. Norman Conquests has just gotten a spectacular review from the New York Times. Congrats to all!
kevinspacey,Opening night show just finished. They did great. Bunch of reviews already in and are raves! So happy for company. Everyone should go!
kevinspacey,@Joker2U Appreceiate that. Which is why I prefer not to be lumped in with all who happen to be well known but who do not share my profession
kevinspacey,@akojen well I've never been that moved to defend my character against those who spread negative comments. Having a thick skin has value.
kevinspacey,@mikemuldo very easy. Celebrity is not a profession. That word has now come to mean & how it is used is not a club I wish to be a member of
kevinspacey,Thanks for the good wishes for opening tonite of Norman Conquests on Broad. So excited can hardly stand it. Tanks all who will go see them.
kevinspacey,"@dawnjohio Sorry, not following. Like the public forum aspect and want to not open myself up to direct messages. + its better we all share"
kevinspacey,"@ZenGrouch I didn't feel the impulse to judge him. I was simply engaged by his vision, his passion and drive to complete a dream."
kevinspacey,@annelisomlo HELLO!
kevinspacey,@dmsKevieBear Is this the real KevieBear or an impostor?
kevinspacey,"@jenblom Without question, Man On Wire."
kevinspacey,@DavidKellyNY Don't have that much to begin with so not sure people would really notice the difference.
kevinspacey,@DrLove1976 our OV/NV actors are great. We don't impose anyone on the director of a play. It is up to them who they want to cast.
kevinspacey,"@RazorKitty it would be good if you were to get over that. As much as I take that in the spirit its meant, I'm just a lucky guy from NJ."
kevinspacey,"@GottaLaff you bet and she was great! And it would have been the summer of 77, I think."
kevinspacey,@skibabys ah no. Living.
kevinspacey,@nyred incredably nice message. Thanks for that. I'm glad your baby got over illness. Some might say listening to me sing induces sickness.
kevinspacey,@NicolaWwilts no. I'm five years in already. So do the math.
kevinspacey,@lisitisi I have had strangers leaving messages for me for a long time. This is just more immediate.
kevinspacey,@JenetDechary there is not Pit in the theatre in NY but we shall raise glasses for sure.
kevinspacey,@LatissaHurt all theatres need new artistic vision. 10 yrs right amount to build strong foundation. Untimately not about me but the company
kevinspacey,@siobhancollin there is not as I have all the help I need.
kevinspacey,@RazorFace and if I ever did decide to do it it allows for dual citizenship. So I would always still be an American!
kevinspacey,@RazorFace Don't believe everything you read. Only said I COULD become one after 10 years. But need to investigate tax implications 1st
kevinspacey,@lizpa26 Be supportive. Laugh loudly and applaud with enormous enthusiasm.
kevinspacey,@Housepromotions gooday mate.
kevinspacey,"@brianatlas Yeah, thanks. That is a good site to go to for info on Norman Conquests . . . which opens tonight on Broadway! Go Old Vic team!"
kevinspacey,@touchdbyaflemin sorry. won't be around. Hope it goes well. Sounds interesting.
kevinspacey,@jacqfrith very kind. thanks. much appreciated.
kevinspacey,@dizmarkpr Can't do that. This a social network not a prod company. @triggerstreet is platform for writers I started to give opportunities
kevinspacey,@SERCH1976 Hello to my friends in Spain!
kevinspacey,@HeywoodJablome1 thank you much!
kevinspacey,@TrishRiley I think the film is fair in how it shows it was confluence of many things & many errors & system that did not work.
kevinspacey,@joancv sorry I don't know anything about visa applications. You should contact American Embassy.
kevinspacey,"@teemcd glad to hear you enjoyed. I think cast is fantastic and will be discovered, once reviews hit Friday. Need to keep getting word out"
kevinspacey,Awesome game. They play again Fri in DC. Go Rangers! Tried to post pic of @jimmyfallon. Won't load. Try later. Hope all havin a good night.

kevinspacey,@scottfishernash ah. no. I would have been about 10 when that was on the air.
kevinspacey,"@raygank thanks. Opening OV play Norman Conq on Broad. Getting an award on Sun from O'Neill Society. Dennehy giving it, which will be cool."
kevinspacey,@Terribly_Mauled haven't seen it yet. Will get one when I get back to UK.
kevinspacey,"@MsLegit I will eventually, but better for it to happen organically."
kevinspacey,"@paulinewood thank you, thank you, thank you"
kevinspacey,"@caliclia Only two at the moment. I like the public forum and don't want to start getting dir messages, which is what Following would allow"

kevinspacey,@vpisteve yeah. Favorite moment; Oscar we made out of a Ken Doll & painted gold & arms came loose from pins and shot out from its body.
kevinspacey,@andyjaybennett excellent. glad @triggerstreet has been a good thing for you. congrats and rock on.
kevinspacey,"@purpleladydi thanks. Always try to be friendly to you all. Had a great time at Sundance, for sure."
kevinspacey,@kaweed16 hello. hi. howdy.
kevinspacey,@RThornton1962 wow. I've never been called 'the pooh' before.
kevinspacey,@NicolaWwilts it was a joke. Not actually thinking of doing it. Not everything said is meant to be taken seriously.
kevinspacey,"@dandeyong with the probs I have with computers, personal help desk wouldn't do the trick. Like public forum so can't follow but thanks."
kevinspacey,@howard74 very kind sir. Thank you for the props.
kevinspacey,@wallanjoker shout out to Brazil! Thanks for sending the nice word.

kevinspacey,"@aprilwinchell I missed your 1st twit. Might be time to revive UTBU, now that you mention. A classic. Can we ever recreate its power? LOL"

kevinspacey,@jasnich It was my birthday the day I started shooting Heartburn. I turned 26. They were awesome. Wished I'd had scenes with Jack!
kevinspacey,@petertravers I'd give it to them both & then wrestle each other to the ground to see who takes it home. That would be a fun Tony moment.

kevinspacey,@Audrey222 Right. Ben Miles who was Bolingbrook in our Richard II at Old Vic three seasons ago. He's hilarious as Tom in NC.
kevinspacey,Whew. Happy I snuck in @triggerstreet film contest at the end there. He was winding up fast & want people to know. Thanks to Stella Atois!
kevinspacey,About to go live on Today Show/NBC. Talking Norman Conquests. Matt Lauer just did terrible Brit accent for intro. I don't talk like that.
kevinspacey,Just did a benefit for Old Vic at Box in NY. Laura M Kelly sang & I did duet w/ Steven Webber & closed with solo. Fun Raiser not Fund Raiser
kevinspacey,Hey the company of Norman Conquests just awarded Best Ensemble by Outer Critics! Also noms for Warchus as dir & play Best Revival! Congrats!
kevinspacey,@kalasala cause the role of Superman was already taken?

kevinspacey,Just out of opening nite for Mary Stuart. Wonderful performances and a beauifully realized production. Congrats to McTeer and Walter & all
kevinspacey,@vothanhtai hey its not that difficult to find time. Its fun to be having conversations with people all over the world.
kevinspacey,@BimlaProduction not sure yet. But its where I love to do plays so bound to happen.
kevinspacey,@CozmicJunkyard yep. Mare and I did Sound of Music and lots of other things. Val was there part time but we did work at Juilliard

kevinspacey,@mathewjames the US. Norman Conquests is playing now on Broadway

kevinspacey,"@ceciloop following others means you can be direct messaged. Prefer public forum, cause following would be like giving an email address out"
kevinspacey,Hey everyone. I'm going to be doing The Today Show Tues morning to promote Norman Conquests. 8:30 hour. Watch if you can.
kevinspacey,@jenkr16420 If you be yourself you can't help but stand out. Its when people try to be others that their own personalities get submerged.
kevinspacey,@TheGreyElephant That ashton kutchner is still top twitter jester . . . for the time being. Ha Ha. Stay tuned!
kevinspacey,@RemainInsane not true. Besides it was a Dreamworks film & WB have no rights. Wouldn't do since (spoiler alert) I'm dead at the end.
kevinspacey,@lostintranslatn short for audience.
kevinspacey,"@julichilliard I hear Exit The King is great. Brian Dennehy doing Desire Under The Elms, which should be fantastic. And Norman Conquests!"
kevinspacey,@StConstans they used to be in residence at the Old Vic - before my time - summer courses. Really good for American's to do. Great training
kevinspacey,"@NicolaWwilts might just seem that way because of Twitter. Same cast, same prod and still brilliant. Just here to do my bit getting word out"
kevinspacey,@nealtucker Train. Study. Motivate own work by finding those with similar ideas. Be collaborative. Its the trip not the destination
kevinspacey,@slatetake cause talent is sometimes overtaken by  laziness and too much focus on money.
kevinspacey,"@hiPetit_gAteau its all about how much sleep before flight, time you land and when you want to sleep at destination. Don't get jet lag"
kevinspacey,"@tonlynski Clint Eastwood, Kate Winslet, Sean Penn, Mike Nichols."
kevinspacey,@JamesShafie glad you enjoyed. Did you do the entire marathon of 3 plays?
kevinspacey,@gabemac not sure you can actually call it break dancing. But when in Turkey do as the Turks do.
kevinspacey,@gypsyroadhog NY is starting to feel English as it might start to rain today.
kevinspacey,@KaraSaun never heard of it. So no.
kevinspacey,@nidge38 isn't Brit eccentric. Aud embraces emotions and family dynamic. 6 wonderful Brit actors. Go to normanconquestsonbroadway.com to see
kevinspacey,@tzikeh I only lived in SO for about 3 yrs. Then was raised in suburbs of LA. So don't really know SO at all
kevinspacey,Hey there. NYC is great today. Yesterday trilogy day at Norman Conquests was awesome. All 3 plays went down a storm. Aud rolling in asiles.
kevinspacey,Check out Short Film contest @danabrunetti & I are doing w/ Stella Artois. $50K to the winner www.tinyurl.com/sasfpts Sorry US res only :(
kevinspacey,@nyred I don't know what that is . . .
kevinspacey,"@JoJo059 ah, yeah. There was even an online piece about our having been there the day after - with pictures of all of us and our new shoes!"
kevinspacey,@JenetDechary it will be announced later in the year. Nothing to report quite yet.
kevinspacey,@amskiwankanobe what happens if no one wins the bet? Do you start a new one called Lust in Sarkozy? Maybe the Fr President is on twitter
kevinspacey,@shaggieshapiro whatever you're smoking . . . its working.
kevinspacey,"@hmobius yeah, but I want the one that comes with a castle."
kevinspacey,"@Monasuehome the weather. And the British sense of humor, which I have just displayed by my answer."
kevinspacey,@shaggieshapiro think you got me mixed up with that Aussie fellow.
kevinspacey,@PeterTaliangis I do not believe it is possible for an American to become a Sir. But I'd take the title of Duke or Lord . . .
kevinspacey,"@Rainnbow so you got Men Who Stare At Goats, Shrink, Telstar to look forward too in 2009. And then Father of Invention. That's a lot of film"
kevinspacey,@PeterTaliangis strange. I am in the UK.
kevinspacey,"@DanielJRoberts Yeah, it is like a true/false quiz"
kevinspacey,@Rubinfee very good idea. If I did something like that I would ask for it to go to a foundation I have started this year to support the arts
kevinspacey,@LeslieSanchez did you see how Page Six tries to make @danabrunetti  and my visit to @shaneandshawn sound like a sordid adventure. Typical
kevinspacey,@GYR8Bellydance it was called National Anthems by Dennis McIntyre. Steven Webber and Mary S. Masterson co-starred. David Grindley directed.
kevinspacey,@sasha7609 Since 2003 I have been the Artistic Director of the OV. Which means I'm involved in everything to do with the theatre.
kevinspacey,@danaseverance there are many programs in diff States. But funding is slipping. Its gonna be a fight to keep amount now given or to increase
kevinspacey,@sasha7609 what you asking? OV is a theatre that runs all year long with many diff productions and programs for ed & outreach. Specific ?
kevinspacey,"@shaneohagan you make me sound like Tom Jones - knickers getting throw. And yeah, its tough after a while."
kevinspacey,@MerleChloe yes. started OV/NV 8 years ago. It is our program.
kevinspacey,"@vocepoco not true/always meet fans at SD. Want to keep sellers of my sig away so no more DVD's, 8x10's etc. Not fair to those who saw play."
kevinspacey,"Hey folks, I'm told the BBC interview won't air till the week of April 27th. As soon as I know details I will pass along."
kevinspacey,@TheBandBlake alas I will not be in the country. Hope new group is working out. Enjoy the tour.
kevinspacey,@ralbon I did. He's a genius and a wild cat
kevinspacey,@PsychicBear just doing my bit
kevinspacey,"@sethkamon indeed. Did - if you can believe - Mousetrap at their winter home at a college, just outside of DC."
kevinspacey,"@RISE_AGAIN interesting position given that there are more cuts to come. We get none at Old Vic, so couldn't disagree more."
kevinspacey,@shaneohagan is this just a little poetic ditty that you do? And its a flat cap I wear in my flat and there is nothing racy about it.
kevinspacey,@honovic true. I thought his show inspiring and extremely funny. Enjoyed our little twit bit together
kevinspacey,"Just finished interview at OV for BBC 10 o'clock news on arts funding. Lovely interviewer, Razia Iqbal. Stay tuned for when it airs."
kevinspacey,Saw good show last night in london. Stovepipe at W12 Shepards Bush. Play where aud wanders through diff spaces. 5 actors play all parts
kevinspacey,I'm going to sign off guys. Lots of work to do. Catch you in a few days.
kevinspacey,@timskipper I'm just an actor. Don't really understand the whole obsession with that horrible word.
kevinspacey,@LittleMingo The Old Vic Theatre.
kevinspacey,@MichaelWHill No. I'm here running a theatre. That is what brought and that is keeps me.
kevinspacey,@Hawser24 sorry but I wouldn't have too and have no idea.
kevinspacey,@SusanPAus because I just want people to use common sense. Too many ?'s I've been asked a million times.
kevinspacey,"@J0di Oh. No I'm not a member of anything on the web, forum or anything. Except Twitter and I'm still getting the hang of this."
kevinspacey,@gypsyroadhog none
kevinspacey,@J0di have no idea what that is.
kevinspacey,"@damana yeah, cause I keep getting the same kinds of questions, so I thought I'd try to explain why I can't answer specifically yet, to all"
kevinspacey,"@spaceyfan while I am at OV I cannot go to Broad with a musical. Its not what I'm in UK to do. Maybe in 6 years I could consider, not now"
kevinspacey,"Hello from UK. All you asking career ?'s, I don't know anything but next film and OV, that I can't talk about yet. Announce in May.  Sorry."
kevinspacey,@twituyu Cool. But its just a different kind of play. Will see it.
kevinspacey,@isabellacane quarantine abolished years ago. Only need current health paper and she can ride next to me in cabin. Under on way into UK
kevinspacey,"@Thomsk56 It is continuous action, so there would be so many characters talking on 3 stages, it would be like a Altman film gone mad."
kevinspacey,@karl_physio it is not. Never been there.
kevinspacey,@bergmanlevi SHOUT OUT TO BUDAPEST!
kevinspacey,"@Sasabelle you have a sister named Claud? Ok; Very DEEP voice: HELLO, CLAUD."
kevinspacey,"@matt49er Mini is a well trained, muti-tasking, international traveller, friend to many & baths reg. Very loyal. No resemblance I can see."
kevinspacey,@mstep57 never saw the Conti one. But I can say its well worth the drive.
kevinspacey,@jkneen Mini. And thanks for budging over. Its always crowded.
kevinspacey,@Fionaone only one dog now. And Mini is her name. Battersea rescue 11 years ago. The most awesome dog. Still thinks she's 4.
kevinspacey,@Borrorrvitch then maybe you haven't seen him done well. I think he's the closest living playwright to Chekhov we have. What have you seen?
kevinspacey,@dmmerlot a total shout out to my alumni. Went there a few weeks ago to do doc on Shakespeare Fest. Mare Winningham joined. Wild to return.
kevinspacey,@Tcscoach sounded like you were accusing Vic of stealing your wallet though. + and - for him.
kevinspacey,@becksbissell good for you. hope you enjoy and that it plants the seeds for many future outings to see live theatre. Nothing comes close.
kevinspacey,"Happy Easter to everyone out there in Twitter land. Back in London. Ran this morning along the river. Great to be back, though US was good."
kevinspacey,@becksbissell dancing at lughnasa. Great Brian Friel play with A Corr of the Corr Sisters making her stage debut. Its a great production.
kevinspacey,"Watched tonights Norman play, Table Manners. Another packed house and wonderful audience reaction. Today is their 1st trilogy day. Excited."
kevinspacey,@LisaTefft remember might be 10th time for me but 1st time for them. Just don't like pics taken without asking. Rude & like you're in a zoo
kevinspacey,@LisaTefft all who asked for my sig were very cool & wasn't bugged. Just didn't take pics cause/lots follow & don't want life as photo shoot
kevinspacey,@janeebaker I am but they do still allow me to travel. I live in London but not without freedom
kevinspacey,@FabDesigner kids laughing
kevinspacey,@penrefe suddenly got damn cold.
kevinspacey,@NicolaWwilts I have not been in London for weeks. But I eventually will so chill. But I won't respond here about mail.
kevinspacey,"@peege88 prob not. But if you manage it right, the pros far outweigh the cons. Its a blessing to do what one loves to do."
kevinspacey,@calindrome yeah I know. But following allows direct replys and would be like giving out my email. I like that its a public forum. All share
kevinspacey,@lilyopatra what to order
kevinspacey,"@_faeriequeen I'd say he's fairly busy doing three plays at once. I'm sure he'll be back, but tech & previews are very demanding."
kevinspacey,"@ELBEEJAY true but its the quality that determines the reply, isn't it?"
kevinspacey,"@Pookthy yeah, but celebrity is not a profession. So I've never considered myself in that category. So its always odd to be called that."
kevinspacey,"@MikeMathia been working all day, catching up on a thousand things. Now I'm going to go walk Mini and get something to eat. I've earned it."
kevinspacey,@ariel_carpenter I rented a house there a long time ago. But I wouldn't call it MINE. But it was the bomb.
kevinspacey,Enjoying twitting and some of the ? are OK and I try to answer but prefer conversation. Lets steer away from it becoming interview. Cool?
kevinspacey,@jaks8373 Paul Thomas Anderson and Ed Norton!
kevinspacey,"@DominicDeAngelo since its a film about things of the heart - go for red, I'd say."
kevinspacey,@GottaLaff wasn't in it - and it was Pierce College. But built and moved sets. Summer between 9th and 10th grades. Did Gypsy there later.
kevinspacey,@civilred last year 64 shows at the festival were born out of OldVic/NewVoices program. So we're doing our bit.
kevinspacey,"@mobilerobot I told him ""Tell them we're busy""! Got a laugh. People should be more respectful of live performances"
kevinspacey,"@tzikeh ah, memories. thanks."
kevinspacey,@NicolaWwilts no plans too.
kevinspacey,@latissahurt she was with me in NY.  Though last night she went missing with the car keys.  Staggered in at 7 AM. So independent.
kevinspacey,"@DrLove1976 its like a supermarket. Like saying see you at Wallmart, Safeway, 7-11.  Translation; the only job your going to get after this"
kevinspacey,@stevecart6 don't you know not to pay attention to reviews. Just one opinion. Go and see for yourself. How bad can it be to watch Dench.
kevinspacey,@NicolaWwilts blue . . . No red . . . No . . . Ahhhhhhh. Monty Python reference.
kevinspacey,@TheGreyElephant that's what happens when you break the speed limit in a convertable.
kevinspacey,@NicolaWwilts my part in Bridge is at least 3 years away. Don't know yet. Keep tuned.
kevinspacey,@relbelle the hazzards of a tiny theatre. Sorry
kevinspacey,I am now on stage with Eddie Caveman Izzard.
kevinspacey,"Got to go, so quickly for all; I will do Bridge Project. Not directing a film. Glast the fest. No I won't call and leave a mess. Bye for now"
kevinspacey,@spaceyfan I think you read me wrong. I am not directing any film in the near future. No plans. Don't have the time.
kevinspacey,@spaceyfan that's the plan.
kevinspacey,"@NealMichaelsUK many places. Loads of travel over the past years. Weekends away, canal boats trips . . . Glastonbury!"
kevinspacey,@nerdist Sorry to disappoint but don't live in LA. London is home. Only rented out there but haven't in over a decade. So no sugar for you
kevinspacey,@spaceyfan No plans at the moment. Taking on directing a film is a year long commitment and I simply don't have that kind of window now
kevinspacey,@cheyenne1218 yep. For the past six and half years.
kevinspacey,@KimberlyPennell it was filmed during its London run
kevinspacey,@Sabrinella thank you. Could you believe the host sang Imagine to me. That was a bit awkward.
kevinspacey,"Okay. Its now snowing in NYC. I think I'm going back to London, where its warmer ~ if you can believe it."
kevinspacey,What with the freezing weather in NYC. Its April.
kevinspacey,Just watched 1st preview of Norman Conquests at Circle in Square NYC. Brilliant. Aud loved it! So happy for the cast & Matt Warchus ace dir

kevinspacey,@GregLongstreet the entire British cast is in NY.
kevinspacey,@joshuastecker I couldn't pick just one. I love them and all are worth catching. Throw a coin.
kevinspacey,@oldsoulink no. the mag changed those. I speak American but its the UK so you go with the flow. I promise I have not adopted a phony accent.
