derrenbrown,"@WhoisCooper As a fellow Stoic fan, have you read Epictetus' 'Handbook'? Great stuff."

derrenbrown,"@iWrnr3rd Nice pic. It was fun and you were both lovely, thank you both for coming. Dx"
derrenbrown,@Longsongs maybe that's what she said. Hard to tell as she was doing her impression of you at the time and we were both laughing.
derrenbrown,"Indeed RT @Wardatrigger: Time's Man of the Year is a measure of influence, good or bad. The Mail just seemed to plainly adore him"
derrenbrown,Booked to go see my old 'right hand man' the brilliant @andynyman in Abigail's Party. Can't wait. http://t.co/tMeI6kG3
derrenbrown,@garethdivitini tricky. I'm in the car. I have milk though.
derrenbrown,I am now in the hugely rewarding post-cold heavy snot-blowing phase. Keeping you updated.
derrenbrown,So true RT @alaindebotton: Much of how we feel about the rest of our lives is determined by what lies ahead of us in the next few hours.
derrenbrown,"The Daily Mail LOVED him too. Not a joke.  RT @UberFacts: Time Magazine's ""Man of the Year"" in 1938 was Adolf Hitler."
derrenbrown,@Longsongs yes. She said she finds you 'obvious' and 'generic'.

derrenbrown,@LittleSmudger I think they only get funnier.
derrenbrown,@CorBlimeyGuvnor apple and blackberry! Rhubarb can shove itself.
derrenbrown,@markpayne0 bone dry vodka martini with a twist.
derrenbrown,@bruis3d that these questions will never end.
derrenbrown,@samargn for some people definitely. For others it does nothing.
derrenbrown,@AmyFerguson95 yes it's normally lovely (apart from when people are weird or unpleasant of course). Always a treat after shows.
derrenbrown,"@SimonTrez I do think about it. At the
moment too many other ppl would read it, so better to wait. Might think of something  appropriate."
derrenbrown,@bendickason I believe it's taken off quite nicely. But they also know its not real. Ideal. People making their own luck.
derrenbrown,@MacKenL Bach! All the way.

derrenbrown,@capitalxuk I think you didn't. Am in a car driving from Manchester to Bristol wearing jeans.
derrenbrown,Laughter as remedy: watching @louisck in the car. He just gets better each time. Fave stand up. Him and @SarahKSilverman do it so well.

derrenbrown,"@AliceSibley Yup, fraid so. (Though I can get DVDs of TV shows and watch them on my projector screen, sometimes do that with fave shows)"
derrenbrown,@drama_grace Never watch myself... No TV. X
derrenbrown,"Oh dear, badly put. I didn't mean that W is drab. Just that on a wet day, a drab building in it (or any city) is made cosy by the rain."
derrenbrown,@markymark_w touring. At the Grand theatre his week.
derrenbrown,"@AShortFuse no, but judging from your avatar and profile, are you sure you're not me in my 20s? Strange sense of time warp."

derrenbrown,"The temherte slaq! Good idea. Now how to type it.http://bit.ly/InWCJs
RT @robin101962: cld start Twitter use of the Ethiopian  sarcasm mark"
derrenbrown,Greatest twitter frustration: sarcasm being missed. (Eg my response to recent sanctimonious 'cherish love instead' tweet re pencil).
derrenbrown,Somehow nice to tweet ones feats to the Twitter winds: somehow creepy to meet people who tell you everything you've been up to.
derrenbrown,"@TheSteveMeth yes yes, Teignmouth and Dawlish were the highlight."
derrenbrown,The stations of big cities (eg Exeter) take on a stirring and mighty quality after the charm bracelet of smaller ones; drabness reassessed.
derrenbrown,"Taking a train along the South Coast today, through tiny stations and with sea silver and stormy, is an unmitigated delight."
derrenbrown,"@TomCook24 cut-throat at home, Gillette on tour or when filming (just in case I nick). LOVE a nice shave &amp; all the trimmings. Ner-night."
derrenbrown,Also time spent learning card moves from @olliemealing &amp; lunching with him &amp; his luvly lady. Enthusiasm for card magic briefly refreshed.
derrenbrown,"Day off: sat reading on same chair in window of hotel bar 10am-6pm, then following arse ache moved across to sofa til now (midnightish)."

derrenbrown,@Caitlin9889 sadly massive legal restrictions for under 18s. Sorry :)
derrenbrown,@Starshinemagic3 ?? 'Course I didn't. Application process sadly nothing to do with looks. More intricate reasons for choosing ppl!
derrenbrown,"RT @JRhodesPianist: Top tip: look 10 years younger instantly by adding 10 years to your actual age when asked how old you are.
Ur welcome."
derrenbrown,Boat trip abandoned. All too ridiculous and apparently dangerous in this weather. Missed my steam train. :(
derrenbrown,"RT @MATTakaDonPedro: I filled out the application form. Anything else I can do to enhance my chances of selection?
&gt;Depends. Real pic?"
derrenbrown,Everyone in waterproofs. Guide unintelligible. Tweeting in rough water making me seasick. All very funny.
derrenbrown,Heading out on very English ferry trip in rain &amp; cold around Torquay. Is followed by a steam-train journey: the bit I'm looking forward to.
derrenbrown,Another sleepless night for all of us in the hottest hotel in the world. Miserable. Lovely staff though.

derrenbrown,@PrincessTorquay ah thank you... (There goes a running tweet theme then. I had heard of a second one in the loo...)
derrenbrown,Good demonstration of how compelling our own limited perspectives are.
derrenbrown,Occasionally catch tail end of someone's process of getting upset because they think I'm ignoring them. Please don't! Tis madness.
derrenbrown,"Sometimes read of ppl angry/sad I haven't ever replied to tweets. 'He owes it to fans' etc. With a mil fllwrs, prob only see 1% of tweets."
derrenbrown,"@JRoggyRog @TimmyElsworth I have over a mill fllwrs. So prob only see 1% of tweets. 1st I've seen of yours. Sadly unavoidable, apologies x"
derrenbrown,@rakishdesign @alaindebotton As if... I bow before the master of the twitty apophthegm.
derrenbrown,"@BenRSheldon the emptiness referred to the topic of the gods, not science..."
derrenbrown,@AlexRomeo you have exquisite taste. Nothing like it. X
derrenbrown,Easier to talk boldly of the gods than of man/science: the emptiness (&amp; our ignorance) of topic affords broad range &amp; liberty of handling.
derrenbrown,Christine and Amy gave me the eggs. They are not the names I gave the eggs.
derrenbrown,"The eggs are fantastic. Thank you, Christine and Amy. Whoe'er you are. http://t.co/194cB0Ue"

derrenbrown,@harrygbarnes yup.
derrenbrown,"If Jon/Clara/Bob/Becky/Ashley or other lovely staff members see it, do let me know... X"
derrenbrown,"Having lost my fancy pencil a week ago, I bought a new one, solid silver, & just left it on the buggering train I was previously enjoying."
derrenbrown,"@RoryHaynes yes, cosy warm wombness."
derrenbrown,"@IRBenHunter a few autograph & discreet photo asks, but when you're already v happy & tranquil they don't spoil it. 1st class helps too..."
derrenbrown,"Few things more enjoyable than being tucked up on a train w/ tea, book and a quiet carriage. One of the principle pleasures of not driving."
