lupefiasco,MOST people in the world actually do use cremation as the main source of body disposal if im not mistaken @Dom_Perignon94 @Zimzzallabim
lupefiasco,even the subconscious is is not FREE but needs constrained context to even have its surreal structure @overcaine @AsH617mj @abdashsoul
lupefiasco,"I dare say there is no such thing as FREE thought and ""free thinkng"" itself is the construct of context @overcaine @AsH617mj @abdashsoul"

lupefiasco,can the north star be seen from all around the world? i think tht answers that... @HectikLifestyle @abdashsoul

lupefiasco,star alignment is easy seeing as how star formations barely move in any radical way and can be tracked using the naked eye @abdashsoul
lupefiasco,"they had equipment @LifeFer cranes, rollers, lifts, drills, etc simplicity of pyra design also explains pyra's in distant isolated cultures"
lupefiasco,think about it @abdashsoul what could you accomplish with an endless supply of free labor who just so happen to think you are God?

lupefiasco,My first true love was literature so i will return to that...lupe fiasco ends here...
lupefiasco,but my heart is broken and i see no comfort further along this path only more pain. I cannot participate any longer in this...
lupefiasco,This album will probably be my last...its been a pleasure to have all my fans provide so much love an inspiration for me and my family
lupefiasco,i'd die for them...but they'd probably spit on my grave...i still will die for them...just bury me in a place far from their reach...Amin
lupefiasco,i have spoken peace only 2 receive vitriol and malice in return. My brother seeks destruction my sister seeks attention paths to nothingness
lupefiasco,my father i have spoken the truth to them yet it has only made my life in this world more troubled. i can bear this no longer...
lupefiasco,"I cant go 4 that @ChiefKeef &amp; i cant let the people i love, including you my nigga, go 4 that either. We kings not fucking savages and goons"
lupefiasco,"I'm trying to DO better @ChiefKeef as we all should. We were born with no expectations to make it. born in the hood, live there die there.."
lupefiasco,i choose not to indulge becuz its lil guys that look up to me so i try and show them a better way @ChiefKeef i aint try to be BE better
lupefiasco,ive seen it in every way you can possibly imagine and its nothing to be proud of @ChiefKeef it TAKES and TAKES till there is nothing left
lupefiasco,i love u lil bruh @ChiefKeef...i really really do from the bottom of my fucking heart. I know that street shit like the back of my hand.

lupefiasco,"by the way #Barcelona...Gaudi Church... WOW Mucho Impressido!!!

America may soon become where i ""USED"" to live... #EXODUS"
lupefiasco,tough times ahead of us...
lupefiasco,"Salvation is away, damnation is afoot and Thanatos rules these days. Prepare yourselves u who are compassionate. May God have mercy...Amin"
lupefiasco,To u few who possess an honest compassion spend your tears in wisely worry your minds not of loss for u already possess all you ever needed
lupefiasco,a world without compassion is truly a hell all its own. To the tiny jewels that sparkle in this all consuming darkness your heaven is within
