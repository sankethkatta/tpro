hootsuite,"@ColtonMulligan Yep. Check the ""Referrals and Regional Stats"" section on the stats page."
hootsuite,"@hostingsearch Yep. On someone's tweet (e.g. on a page w/ search results), you'll see a follow button."
hootsuite,@The3Tomatoes Send us a DM with your email address and we'll get you set up.
hootsuite,@deepredbells Hey now. That tickles.
hootsuite,@sujamthe No prob! Let us know if you have any other questions about multi-user setup.
hootsuite,"@sujamthe I think I just responded to her on GetSatisfaction... =) If changing her email doesn't work, let us know."
hootsuite,@howdomedia It looks like you shrank an invalid URL to create that ow.ly link. Is this the URL you wanted to link to: http://ow.ly/hnwV ?
hootsuite,Thank you to @sujimoon @ClydeLerner and @BrunoBernardino for donating to HootSuite & supporting our efforts!
hootsuite,"@sujamthe Currently, only an admin user can add Twitter profiles to HootSuite. This is something we may be changing in the future."
hootsuite,@HoustonLawy3r We'll take a look at that ow.ly URL. Looks like shortening it stripped out some params.
hootsuite,@DavidZumini Do a Twitter search for HootSuite 2.0... you may see a couple of opportunities to get invite codes via ReTweeting things
hootsuite,@white_eagle Your followers can hide the bar if they like as well. Some people like the sharing features of the ow.ly bar.
hootsuite,"@white_eagle Also, we're considering allowing HootSuite users to turn off the ow.ly bar for their acct. This may be a paid feature."
hootsuite,@white_eagle Your followers can hide the bar if they like as well. Some people like the sharing features of the ow.ly bar.
hootsuite,"@inspiredworlds Our new version auto-updates... stay tuned, more invites to the private beta are coming soon!"
hootsuite,"@CarriBugbee Our latest version has auto-updating, so you'll be able to see updates. Stay tuned for more invites for the private beta!"
hootsuite,"@samarudge It looks like you accidentally shrunk the text ""with the lyrics"" instead of a URL when you created that ow.ly link."
hootsuite,"@howdomedia Aha. Yeah, I see there was a problem with that ow.ly link you sent. We're on it!"
hootsuite,"@MyArmyLife You want to create ""pending"" columns for your profiles, if you haven't already. Click Add Column &gt; Profile Feed &gt; Pending Tweets"

hootsuite,"@white_eagle You can permanently hide the ow.ly bar. Click the drop-down 2 the right of the close box, then check ""never show the ow.ly bar"""
hootsuite,@genissachantel HootSuite doesn't have any auto-follow features. The problems w/ auto-following people may be from another tool.
hootsuite,Thank you to @adultebookshop @samCHC and @bowwowhaus for donating to HootSuite & supporting our efforts!
hootsuite,Note to users on private beta: Twitter is having an issue with IDs in their search. HS search columns currently return duplicate results.
hootsuite,@rafer Thanks for reporting that issue. Can you shoot us an email at info@hootsuite.com ? It'd be great to get more info to troubleshoot
hootsuite,Twitter is working on fixing a problem where some users see tweets from users they do not follow. Read more here: http://ow.ly/hg7y
hootsuite,"@PFN1 Can you let us know which tweets weren't sent? Check your ""pending"" tab to see if there were problems connecting to Twitter."
hootsuite,@healthy_tweets We're going to bump those limits slightly soon. Stay tuned!
hootsuite,"@ElaineEllis Check your ""pending"" tab -- your tweets may have failed because we couldn't connect to Twitter?"
hootsuite,@tianamah And then shrank that text by accident?
hootsuite,"@tianamah You may have pasted the URL in wrong -- it looks like you pasted the text ""Implementing Process Based Management in Organizations"""
hootsuite,@FreeFunGuides That's something we'll be improving in the future. Thanks for the feedback!
hootsuite,@JGuthmann That's something we're planning on changing in the future... thanks for the feedback!
hootsuite,@rafer Are you allowing cookies? The opt-out should set a cookie in yr browser that will hide the bar for all ow.ly links.
hootsuite,@tianamah How did you create that link? using the Hootlet?
hootsuite,@tianamah It looks like the URL for that ow.ly link is invalid -- links to Implementing Process Based Management in Organizations
hootsuite,@tianamah Can you let us know which link you had a problem with? Thanks!
hootsuite,@greenlight360 Looks like your tweets for that time period are still in our database. Perhaps you weren't looking @ the right date range?
hootsuite,@greenlight360 We'll check out those missing tweets.
hootsuite,@ijustine let us know if you would like 2.0 private beta access.
hootsuite,@bsoler you haven't seen hootsuite 2.0. ping @hootsuite to get access.
hootsuite,Sounds like Twitter's getting the slowness sorted out. We're seeing much speedier response times now.
hootsuite,@dadewilliams Good point. That's something we'll continue to think about. Thanks for the feedback.
hootsuite,Thank you to @TotallyCreative @miscellanies and @CommaFactory for donating to HootSuite & supporting our efforts!
hootsuite,Twitter's working on the slowness problems: http://ow.ly/h0l8
hootsuite,. @city_paper Yeah. Sounds like Twitter  has been a little slow for everyone today.
hootsuite,@dadewilliams We thought of that... waaay more trouble than it was worth. =) We might consider it again later.
hootsuite,@keubs That's something we've added in the new version of HootSuite (currently in private beta). More invite codes coming soon!
hootsuite,@carnivas Keep your eyes open for invite codes to our private beta. Tons of new features we think you'll like... =)
hootsuite,@blue_cat_online We'll keep investigating this. Thanks for helping us troubleshoot it!
hootsuite,@Stephanvs It's in private beta at the moment -- keep your eyes open for more invite code giveaways.
hootsuite,"@AcmePhoto Yep, we do. You can invite editors to your account and give them access to whichever Twitter accts you like."
hootsuite,@lihsa Glad you're liking it!
hootsuite,"@Jerry_Bio Aha. Okay, we've got it fixed. Give it another try."
hootsuite,@PowerJourneys You might not have saved it correctly if you're being taken to the dashboard. Check the video: http://ow.ly/gUj8
hootsuite,@blue_cat_online Couldn't replicate your issue in any of our copies of IE 6. Are you able to upgrade to IE 7 or Firefox 3?
hootsuite,Thank you to @entwipreneur @pjryan @spencerharris and @Edusys for donating to HootSuite & supporting our efforts!
hootsuite,"@PowerJourneys If you're using IE, you'll need to right-click on the Hootlet and save to favorites."
hootsuite,"@Jerry_Bio You'll want to clear your cookies, not your cache... we'll look into that js error as well. Does it work in another browser?"
hootsuite,@MarieLancup We have no current plans to do that... but Firefox has a built in spellchecker. Check it out.
hootsuite,@Jerry_Bio Try clearing your cookies and see if you can log in after that. Let us know if that works.
hootsuite,"@fabwrldgoodlif Ok, good to know. Yes, if you post-date blog posts, they won't be fed to Twitter until up to 1 hr past that date/time."
hootsuite,@dadewilliams Gotcha. We'll take a look.
hootsuite,"@fabwrldgoodlif Oh, I see. You're talking about your RSS feeds? How frequently do you have HootSuite set up to check your feed?"
hootsuite,@fabwrldgoodlif Check the Pending tweets tab -- was there an issue connecting to Twitter?
hootsuite,@ptacoustic As soon as our private beta is released to the public... stay tuned. Will probably be within a month.
hootsuite,@usatourismboard That's something we're planning on adding in the future. Thanks for the feedback.
hootsuite,"@dadewilliams Do you mean the small icons @ top of each column? If so, yeah, that's something we are working on fixing."
hootsuite,@blue_cat_online Interesting that it works on refresh. Must be an IE 6 bug. We'll take a look. Thanks for reporting it!
hootsuite,@Jerry_Bio Shouldn't be. What is the error that IE reports? What version of IE are you using?
hootsuite,@thewinchesterau Let us know what problems you had with Ping.fm integration.
hootsuite,@blue_cat_online Can you let us know which ow.ly link gave you problems? Do either of these work 4 u: http://ow.ly/gT9N or http://ow.ly/gT9Q
hootsuite,"@AnnaBoy If you forgot your HS password, click the ""forgot password"" link on the login page."
hootsuite,"@AnnaBoy You changed your Twitter pwd, or your HootSuite pwd? If Twitter, click on Settings &gt; Manage Profiles &gt; Edit to change."
hootsuite,@Stephanvs Our new beta version has auto-refresh... keep your eyes open for private beta invites.
hootsuite,"@dadewilliams Current limit is 20 users per group column. Keep in mind you can have multiple columns, tho. We may change this limit later."
hootsuite,@dadewilliams Or spread it over multiple monitors. Woohoo!
hootsuite,Looks like search.twitter.com is pretty slow at the moment. HootSuite searches and search columns may be slow because of this.
hootsuite,@dadewilliams Done!
hootsuite,@hforrette I heard you were having trouble with ow.ly links? Can you let us know which links didn't work for you?
hootsuite,@jawallace That's something we're thinking about. You can suggest new features in our support forum: http://ow.ly/gO0Z
hootsuite,@dadewilliams What browser are you using? Can you send a screenshot?

hootsuite,How I paid tribute to Michael Jackson.  Check out my moves! http://www.eternalmoonwalk.com/     Search for: Owly
hootsuite,@lornali Your followers can disable the bar as well. Many people like seeing it b/c it makes RTing easy.
hootsuite,@BethHarte The group limit is something we may change in the future. Your RTs shouldn't be limited -- are you getting an error?
hootsuite,@raquelwilson That's something we've thought about. Feel free to suggest new features on our support forum: http://ow.ly/gJoA

hootsuite,@dadewilliams Feel free to make feature suggestions on our forum: http://ow.ly/gtea
hootsuite,@dadewilliams Cool. Keep us posted on how it goes.
hootsuite,"@Twitter_Tips Hmm, the ow.ly frame isn't supposed to be there on mobile browsers. I guess we're not detecting mobile IE correctly."
hootsuite,@stefan4m Definitely. We'll always account for summer time / daylight savings. But it is confusing to have the GMT +/- change in the menu.
hootsuite,"@luvzwool What error are you getting? A 404 or a ""cannot connect to server"" problem, or something else?"
hootsuite,"@EricMueller Hey, nice button!"
hootsuite,@luvzwool Which ow.ly links are giving you trouble?
hootsuite,@ndefontenay Have you tried the Hootlet? Go to hootsuite.com and drag the hootlet to your toolbar (or right-click & save in IE)
hootsuite,@alncl How frequently do you have HootSuite set up to check your feed? Let us know and we can help troubleshoot.
hootsuite,"@stefan4m If you choose London, it should work as expected."
hootsuite,"@stefan4m Yeah, our timezone menu is a little weird -- the labels acct. for Summer Time in the UK. We'll address this."
hootsuite,"@ghippolt On the ow.ly social bar, you'll see plus and minus buttons -- these let your followers rate your links."
hootsuite,"@OCReggie (by ""your users"" I meant ""your followers,"" of course.)"
hootsuite,@OCReggie Your users can opt-out of the ow.ly social bar if they want. And it doesn't hurt SEO -- bots are served a 301 redirect.
hootsuite,@1evelup Why's that?
hootsuite,Thank you to @NitwitNews @IndiBandFollow and @MP3finder for donating to HootSuite & supporting our efforts!
hootsuite,"@MetromixNewYork Haha! =) Happens to the best of us, my friend. Let us know if you have any other trouble."

hootsuite,@MetromixNewYork What's the error message you're getting?
hootsuite,@dklimke That's something we've been thinking a lot about...
hootsuite,"@SecAdept Yep, we've fixed that XSS issue (see the ""vendor response"" section at the bottom of that post)."
hootsuite,@ColleenCoplick Do they have their updates protected? Right now groups only work for tweets on the public timeline. We may change this later
hootsuite,@ColleenCoplick Groups are limited to 20 people at the moment.
hootsuite,@bkbirla Are you able to adjust the feed so the pubDate tags correctly show the item's posted date?
hootsuite,"@bkbirla Strange. Looks like the pubDate tags on that feed are all set to the current date/time, whenever the page is loaded."
hootsuite,@nrdavis Yep! That's something we've got in the new private beta version. More invite codes coming soon!
hootsuite,"@KJS_MyXenzo If you change your avatar on Twitter, go to Settings &gt; Manage Profiles &gt; Sync Avatars with Twitter to update HootSuite's image"
hootsuite,@steveyoung74 You mean the Hootlet? It's just a bookmark like any other -- try right-clicking and deleting it.
hootsuite,@RoboPeter Definitely something we're thinking about. Thanks for the suggestion.
hootsuite,@kellylivesay Try right-clicking on the Hootlet and saving it as a favorite. Hope that helps!
hootsuite,"@ocjess This is something we've fixed in the new private beta version, though. More invite codes coming soon!"
hootsuite,"@ocjess Yes--we use Twitter search to find popular tweets, and they limit how far back we can search."
hootsuite,"@Silverfox616 If it's on Twitter's site, it sounds like an issue with Twitter.com, no? You may want to contact them about it."
hootsuite,"@stirmyworld Let us know what issues you were having, and we'll check it out."

hootsuite,@hootnews let us d it to you.
hootsuite,"@fabwrldgoodlif Also, it looks like you also have Twitterfeed set up as well as our RSS. That'll result in some duplicate posts: be careful!"

hootsuite,@bostonmarketer We're working on improving our FAQ page for the new version. Let us know if you have specific ?s and we can help.
hootsuite,@rekindled That's the first we've heard of that... we'll take a look. Thanks!
hootsuite,"@ileanarocio We didn't change anything... can you let us know what you're seeing, and what you expected to see?"
hootsuite,"@NYdelight If you log in to HootSuite, then click on Settings and Manage Profiles, you can update your Twitter password in HootSuite."
hootsuite,"@tinax88 What are you seeing now? Did you change your window size? If so, you can user the column slider in upper-right to resize cols."
hootsuite,Thank you to @CigarPlayer and @understandblue for donating to HootSuite & supporting our efforts!
hootsuite,@tinax88 We use digital courier owls. Hoot!
hootsuite,"@tinax88 If you don't get your email in 1/2 hr, send us a DM with your email address and we'll hurry it along. =)"
hootsuite,@JaysonFlint No problem! Glad we were able to help.
hootsuite,@kramerATL This is something that we've changed in the new version of HootSuite (currently in private beta). =)
hootsuite,@kramerATL Our 'popular tweets' uses search.twitter.com to find your tweet. Sometimes Twitter search doesn't let us go back far enough.
hootsuite,@VIP_Livery That's something we've thought about. Feel free to suggest features on our support forum: http://ow.ly/f5r4
hootsuite,"@JaysonFlint Ok, should be working for you now. Hoot!"
hootsuite,"@kramerATL You can set up a ""signature"" for your tweets in HootSuite, too. Click ""Settings"" and then add your initials."
hootsuite,"Thank you to @ezinearticles, @ryanbarr, @inhouserestrng and @vincevalance for donating to HootSuite & supporting our efforts!"
hootsuite,@Cocopunkz How so? Anything we can do to help?
hootsuite,@Dakshinamurti Looks like they're all working as expected. You should see some posts going out soon.
hootsuite,"@Dakshinamurti Sure, we'll check it out for you. (P.S. if you follow us, we can DM you)"
hootsuite,@Zachsb Can you let us know which RSS feeds/Twitter profiles are causing problems for you? We can check it out.
hootsuite,"@VIP_Livery Not yet, but that's something we've been thinking about."
hootsuite,@JaysonFlint Let us know which Twitter profiles are giving you ow.ly problems and we'll take a look!
hootsuite,@perfectvenue We'll think about that... We were trying to replicate Twitter.com's behavior so people wouldn't tweet accidentally.
hootsuite,@edwardelgar You probably accidentally minimized the tweet bar. There's a slim grey line at the top of page w/ an arrow. Click to expand.
hootsuite,@Dakshinamurti Can you let us know which Twitter accts? We can look into it.
hootsuite,@rachelmarcuse That's something we'll be adding in the future -- we've got some good ideas for it.
hootsuite,@pjhoody Can you log out of HootSuite and then log back in? I think we've resolved the issue you were having. Thanks!
hootsuite,@proteusduxbury Try right-clicking and saving to favorites.
hootsuite,"@allanwhite Not yet. That's something we've been thinking about, though."
hootsuite,@proteusduxbury How so? Are you getting an error message?
hootsuite,"Thank you to @regardsvs, @MalcolmPitcher, @spookyismyname and @Marc_Stevens for donating to HootSuite & supporting our efforts!"
hootsuite,"@ryanmckee You'll need to click on Settings &gt; Profiles and click the ""Sync avatar images"" button to grab new versions from Twitter."
hootsuite,@beckynowlin Glad you got it sorted out. Happy tweeting!
hootsuite,@pjhoody What Twitter profile is giving you the issue?
hootsuite,@pjhoody Try clearing your cookies--that should log you out. Then try logging in again. Let us know if that changes anything.
hootsuite,"@sdwhite Yeah, it's more secure that way -- you don't stay logged in to the machine you left... we may consider changing this eventually."
hootsuite,"@mikechelen Check out our support forum here:  http://ow.ly/ePTA You can suggest features, report issues, etc."
hootsuite,@crazyishsara Right-click on the Hootlet and save to favorites. Hope that helps!
hootsuite,"@BrunoBernardino Let us know what Twitter profile you're seeing this problem with, and we'll check it out."
hootsuite,"@smack416 ...If you edit a Twitter profile, you'll see checkboxes for each editor. Check 'em off to give 'em access."
hootsuite,"@smack416 That's the cool part... you can decide which accounts your editors have access to. Add an editor, then go to settings/profiles..."
hootsuite,"@pjhoody No, we're not... that's odd. Can you try clearing your cache?"
hootsuite,"@smack416 You can, through a single HootSuite account. Add your friend as an editor via the Settings page."
hootsuite,@jwmcphee Keep your eyes peeled for more invite codes to the private beta...
hootsuite,@sdwhite Are you logging in on multiple machines/browsers?
hootsuite,"Thank you to @uabsccc, @merchantsouth, and @onesixtymedia for donating to HootSuite & supporting our efforts!"
hootsuite,@LaurenCeleste That's something we're planning on adding. Thanks for the feedback!
hootsuite,@elainevdw You're right. That was a typo. =)

hootsuite,@JewishAgency Definitely something we're thinking about. Thanks for the feedback!
hootsuite,@mmSeason Hoot! Glad you like it!
hootsuite,Lend an owl a hand? Only a few hours left to vote for HootSuite at #140conf. http://ow.ly/ett7
hootsuite,"@anthroscience Click on ""Settings,"" then click ""Profiles"" tab. You'll see a ""Sync Avatar images"" button. Hope that helps!"
hootsuite,@s_constantine No problem. We'll remove your acct and the feeds. Sorry for the confusion.
hootsuite,@s_constantine How so? Let us know what the issue is.
hootsuite,"@mojophotoco Not just yet, but that's something that will be coming!"
hootsuite,Your clicks are still being recorded. We'll let everyone know when stats are updating as expected.
hootsuite,Stats are taking longer to appear on the site -- we've delayed stats for the moment while we sort out some speed issues. They will be back!
hootsuite,"Thank you to @jdeer0618, @whiskijack, @rightjustified and @GeeksOnaPlane, for donating to HootSuite & supporting our efforts!"
hootsuite,"@ghippolt It'll show up as a dot when you have only one days' worth of data. Once we've got &gt; 1 data point, we can draw pretty lines. =)"
hootsuite,"We've identified the issue that's been slowing us down this AM, and we're taking care of it."
hootsuite,"@OxToastmasters Yep, that's something we've thought about. Thanks for the feedback!"
hootsuite,@dinocelotti We've noticed some speed issues and we're working on improving it.
hootsuite,"We're noticing a big spike in traffic that started early this morning, and it's slowing down our servers. We're working on it!"
hootsuite,We're noticing an issue that's slowing down our servers and causing problems when we try to connect to Twitter. We're working on it!
hootsuite,@nate_elliott Just sent you a DM so we can help you out further. Thanks!
hootsuite,"@CenterWatch Friend us, and we'll DM you an invite code :)"
hootsuite,@nate_elliott Disappeared how? Let us know what the issue is and we'll take a look.
hootsuite,@NikkiPilkington Glad to hear it!
hootsuite,"@pacificIT You can change that prefix if you like, or remove it altogether."
hootsuite,"Thank you to @conflagratio, @seoer, @whistler_select and @ foundersfund, for donating to HootSuite & supporting our efforts!"
hootsuite,@adlyx More invite codes for the v2.0 private beta will be released soon. Keep on the lookout.
hootsuite,@wuson That's a feature we've got in our new version (currently in private beta)
hootsuite,"@TheGuyPalermo We did some maintenance over the weekend, and some users' stats are taking a while to re-calculate. They'll be back shortly."
hootsuite,"@KirstenWynn If you already have a HootSuite account, use the same email address to sign up for the new private beta. Hoot!"
hootsuite,rt me so i can win: @wholefoods is making me hungry #otbc
hootsuite,@aldemark Shouldn't be! Can you send us the specific links that aren't working?
hootsuite,Ty RTtrs @payoladeville @Mark_A_Nolan @cp123 @TwitToWho @cyberbonn @mattmendo @ushneb @ECdavies @londonvoiceover http://ow.ly/ebQD #140conf
hootsuite,"Love hootsuite? Last day, please vote for us! http://ow.ly/eb6U #140conf."
hootsuite,"@anthroscience This maintenance was primarily for performance boost, and in preparation for the upcoming exciting 2.0 release.  Stay tuned!"
hootsuite,"We're back! Thank you all for your patience. Time for ninja owls to take some rest, what a night!"
hootsuite,We hit a slight issue during maintenance. Our team is working on it and will be back soon. Thanks for your patience.
hootsuite,"Maintenance is taking longer than we expected, will be back shortly."
hootsuite,Turning some dials... Cranking some widgets... Reticulating splines... We'll be back shortly.
hootsuite,Our robot ninja owl mechanics are performing some maintenance. Go owls go!
hootsuite,"Heads up, we are changing tonight's maintenance schedule from 11:00pm-1:00am to 1:00am-4:00am. PST.  Owl loves to work at night!"
hootsuite,"We'll be down for maintenance tonight, from 11pm-1am PST. Ow.ly links will continue to work during this time."
hootsuite,We're back online. Happy tweeting.
hootsuite,We're bringing HootSuite.com down for maintenance -- we'll be back at 1am PST. All ow.ly links will work in the meantime.
hootsuite,"Reminder: Hootsuite will be down for some routine maintenance from 11pm-1am PST tonight, 11pm-1am PST Sat, & 11pm-1am PST Sun"
hootsuite,#twitpocalypse has passed and #HootSuite made a smooth transition. Hooty Hoooo!!
hootsuite,@beenswank Our latest version does. More private beta invite codes will be released into the wild soon.
hootsuite,@sleeprun We've got a new version in private beta that addresses pretty much all your feedback. Keep your eyes open for invite codes!
hootsuite,"@klagden That's a good idea, and it's a feature we may eventually add. Thanks for the feedback!"
hootsuite,@sleeprun Are you having issues with the site? Let us know what the problem is.
hootsuite,All your ow.ly links will continue to work while we perform maintenance on HootSuite.com this evening.
hootsuite,"We'll be performing some db maintenance this weekend. Hootsuite will be down from 11pm-1am PST tonight, 11pm-1am PST Sat, & 11pm-1am PST Sun"
hootsuite,@klagden Not sure what you mean by RSS feeds on keyword searches. Our new version (in private beta) has auto-updating embeddable searches...
hootsuite,"@wfpman Haha. No., don't worry. We're fully prepared for the #Twitpocalypse."
hootsuite,"Thank you to @unemployedmag, @youhiring, and @badvc, for donating to HootSuite & supporting our efforts!"
hootsuite,@klagden It may take up to 15 mins for your stats to show up.
hootsuite,@incuLink =) Glad you're liking it. Hoot!
hootsuite,"@BirdBuzzr We get that data straight from Twitter's API. Sometimes their API isn't responsive -- if so, try refreshing, or try again later."
hootsuite,@tudoradam It looks like you were able to log in. We've had some reports that our emails to yahoo get delayed. Did you have a yahoo email?
hootsuite,@incuLink No problem! Happy tweeting.
hootsuite,"@Sue_Anne Our new version has auto-updating. It's in private beta at the moment, but keep on the lookout for invite code giveaways."
hootsuite,"@incuLink http://hootsuite.com is the current stable version. Private beta is @ different URL, which was sent when we sent your invite code."
hootsuite,"@incuLink You can set the auto-refresh time on each tab. Try clicking ""edit tab"""
hootsuite,@KontentCreative We were wondering if anyone noticed that feature yet. Also check out the quick search on the right.
hootsuite,"Thank you to @davemcclure, @roymcclean, @fbfund and @alohawhistler, for donating to HootSuite & supporting our efforts!"
hootsuite,"@maokelan18 Send 'em out to Twitter using HootSuite, and you can view clickthrough stats on them in HootSuite's interface."
hootsuite,@screaminlunatic @incuLink Our new version has auto-updating features. It's currently in private beta. Be on the look out for invite codes.
hootsuite,@alekxtoyhacao Let us know your email address and we'll check it out.
hootsuite,@bhavinm Our new version auto-updates... it's currently in private beta. Keep on the lookout for more beta invite codes.
hootsuite,"Thank you to @rodkirby, @mobilewebsite, and @digitalbrandexp, for donating to HootSuite & supporting our efforts!"
hootsuite,"@londonvoiceover Are you pasting the URL into the ""link"" field to the right of the ""shrink it"" button? Or into the main tweet text field?"
hootsuite,@londonvoiceover Tried shortening that URL and it worked for me: http://ow.ly/dm9H. Are you still having the issue?
hootsuite,"@AnnaBoy Not yet, but that's something we've thought about. Have you seen ""recent RTs"" in the ow.ly bar? (click Tweet button on ow.ly bar)"
hootsuite,@londonvoiceover Can you give us an example URL that won't shorten for you?
hootsuite,@redcrew Is it giving you an error message? Let us know what the issue is.
hootsuite,@ghippolt Definitely. Just drag one of your tabs to sit in the left-most position.
hootsuite,"@davejohnson Ahh, gotcha. Yeah, we might want to change that. It actually sets a cookie that will send you straight to the target page."
hootsuite,"@davejohnson Click the drop-down arrow to the right of the close box on the ow.ly bar, then click the ""never show the ow.ly social bar"" box."
hootsuite,@Marinaisgo We've seen that happen to a couple of different Twitter accounts. It's very weird.
hootsuite,"@ronnieledesma We've also done 4 or 5 beta invite giveaways (Through Mashable, Techvibes, etc). Keep on the lookout for more chances."
hootsuite,@ghippolt Good point -- thanks for the feedback! We'll think about how we can improve this.
hootsuite,"@mmSeason Yes, we will be making a change so that Twitter profile menu ""sticks"" between the two Stats tabs."
hootsuite,"@mmSeason That may indeed be the issue! Hmm, we'll do some tests. Clear your cookies and it should be fine. We'll get to the bottom of it."
hootsuite,@JerrySilver There should be Inbox / Outbox links within your DM tab for each profile. Hope that helps.
hootsuite,@Marinaisgo We just use Twitter search... for some reason she doesn't show up on search.twitter.com either. Odd.
hootsuite,"@barkinj Really? Hmm. We didn't realize that. We'll look into it. In the meantime, it should work without specifying a trigger..."
hootsuite,"@barkinj Also, it'd help if I typed the right URL... Here's a working link to the blog post on Ping.fm integration: http://ow.ly/dcA1"
hootsuite,"@barkinj Check this blog post: http://ow.ly/dcxX If that doesn't answer your ?, let us know what the issue is and we can help troubleshoot."
hootsuite,"@crazeyface In IE, right-click on the Hootlet and save to favourites. See: http://ow.ly/dc5u Also see this screencast:  http://ow.ly/dc5I"

hootsuite,@thejstandard Can you let us know what ow.ly link wasn't working for you? We'll check it out.
hootsuite,@drnelk Indeed it does.
hootsuite,@dougkrile Can you let us know what pages gave you the problem?
hootsuite,@DavidWells Are you using the default BlackBerry browser? Which links didn't work for you?
hootsuite,"@alistairreid Not at the moment, no. You can suggest new features like this one on our GetSatisfaction forum:  http://ow.ly/d9ul"
hootsuite,"Thanks, all you #nextMedia RT'ers. We're sorting through the tweets and we'll DM out invite codes tomorrow. Be sure to follow us!"
hootsuite,"@florist Well, we've got groups in our new v2.0 private beta! Keep your eyes open for more invite codes."
hootsuite,"@Flash It's currently in private beta, but keep your eyes out for more invite codes."

hootsuite,"Thank you to @ds_macs, @gideonmarken, @vfielding and @artistserver, for donating to HootSuite & supporting our efforts!"
hootsuite,"Love HootSuite? Vote for us. No sign-up necessary, just click: http://ow.ly/cZGc"

hootsuite,@daveshustler We would love to send you an invite to HootSuite 2.0 beta. Can you follow us back so we can DM you an invite code?
hootsuite,@atlantabridal We'll take a look. How frequently do you have HootSuite set up to check your feeds?
hootsuite,"Twitter's gonna be down from 8pm - 9pm PST, so HootSuite won't connect to Twitter during that time."
hootsuite,@RobASchneider Sure. We try to send updates when we notice slowness issues. We're working on a change that will help things as well.
hootsuite,"@RobASchneider Still happening for you? We've had periodic speed problems due to load, but it should be ok at the moment. Let us know if not"
hootsuite,"Thank you to @renotile and @ihazzy, for donating to HootSuite & supporting our efforts!"
hootsuite,@VisionCRM @RobASchneider  Let us know what's not working for you. We'll check it out.
hootsuite,"Twitter will be down for one hour of planned maintenance today, from 8p to 9p Pacific. Schedule your tweets accordingly w/ HootSuite!"
hootsuite,"@Marcoayuso You probably set up Ping.fm integration on HootSuite, or you've set Facebook up to get your status from Twitter."
hootsuite,"@ydesautels Do you have your time zone set correctly? Click on ""Settings"" to change it."
hootsuite,"@stevegrossman We'll be adding groups in the future. =) Actually, we have them in our new private beta--be on the lookout for beta invites."
hootsuite,"@loopdiloop We do this differently in the new version of HootSuite--no more ""not found"" tweets. More beta invites coming soon!"
hootsuite,"@loopdiloop We get the tweet text from Twitter search. w/ huge amounts of tweets now, we can only search back a week or two."
hootsuite,"Thank you to @presencemedia, @MaryCritchley, @tinypearlcat, and @jumpswitchmedia for donating to HootSuite & supporting our efforts!"
hootsuite,@igobydoc State breakdowns are trickier and tough to do accurately. But it's something we may add down the road.
hootsuite,"@johnsgunn Only admins can add Twitter profiles currently, see this thread: http://ow.ly/b7Wg That's something we're thinking about changing"
hootsuite,@redrisker This is something we may eventually change... stay tuned for more updates.
hootsuite,"@perusio ow.ly uses cookies so we can remember if you check the ""don't show me the ow.ly bar"" option."
hootsuite,@johnsgunn Can you let us know what spam you're getting?
hootsuite,@SueTodd Let us know what issues you're having. Thanks!
hootsuite,@mmSeason Strange. Did this just start happening today? Try clearing your cookies? We'll investigate as well.
hootsuite,"@loyan Sure, we can cancel your current account and you can start a new one. Let us know if we should do that."
hootsuite,"@vladrys Unfortunately, Twitter's API doesn't support that yet... maybe they'll add it soon!"
hootsuite,@JackiMieler Can you let us know what problems you're having? Thanks.
hootsuite,@Toyota_Aus Give yoiur tweets some excellent reception with @hootsuite 2.0. It's in closed beta right now. Want an invite code?
hootsuite,@getfancy Let us know what problems you're running into.
hootsuite,"@loyan Sure, you can start a new account with a different email address if you like."
hootsuite,@igobydoc Check out the Stats tab -- there's an expandable section that shows which countries your clicks came from.
hootsuite,@loyan We also plan on eventually allowing editors to add their own Twitter accounts. It's something in our long term plans.
hootsuite,@loyan Only admins can add accounts--can you talk to your acct admin and have them add your Twitter profile?
hootsuite,"@UCBearcats We'll let everyone know when it's ready... in the meantime, keep on the lookout for invite codes to the private beta."
hootsuite,"@UCBearcats We've noticed search.twitter.com being a bit slow lately, which can cause HootSuite to be slow. Let us know if you have issues."
hootsuite,"Thank you to @efolgate, @warmwell, @motorpurrr, and @megastarmedia for donating to HootSuite & supporting our efforts!"

hootsuite,@voorhis You can suggest features on our support forum here: http://ow.ly/aEQf
hootsuite,@NicoleSimon That's something we'll think about changing. Might be a nice feature for HootSuite users who retweet via the ow.ly social bar.
hootsuite,@NicoleSimon The ow.ly social bar actually posts the RT to twitter.com -- that way non-HootSuite users can use it... but good idea!
hootsuite,"@mikemueller Click on ""Settings"" to change your time zone. Hope that helps!"
hootsuite,@visitpensacola That's an issue with Power Twitter. See their forum here:  http://ow.ly/aEsi

hootsuite,@stockyscouts Try this: Add a group column with one or two people. Then drag other user avatars from your home feed into that group.
hootsuite,@TransDomo Glad you like it!
hootsuite,@TomButts We had to slow down how often our RSS function checks for updates. It was slowing down our servers. We're @ work on improving it.
hootsuite,@KristieTweets You probably accidentally closed the Tweet bar... See this img: http://ow.ly/9Wi8 Click the little arrow to have it appear.

hootsuite,@HRBlock Excellent! Can you friend me back so I can DM you an invite code?
hootsuite,@oistr Our pleasure! Lots more good stuff to come.
hootsuite,@KristieTweets What's not working for you? Any error message?
hootsuite,"@QuantumGood If you use the same email as your existing acct, it should work fine on the new beta."
hootsuite,@TransDomo That link works fine... I think that's a bug w/ Power Twitter showing you the wrong title. See this thread: http://ow.ly/9Uyl
hootsuite,@zoolcar9 @jstukey More beta invite codes will come soon. Keep your eyes peeled for more opportunities.
