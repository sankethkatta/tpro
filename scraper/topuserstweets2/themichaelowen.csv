themichaelowen,wouldn't of missed. He pulls out at the last minute and doesn't touch him. Not having that's a red at all.

themichaelowen,Not having that at all. He didn't touch him and to say there was intent is laughable.
themichaelowen,Most of you seem certain that it was a red card. Didn't look like it to me. Let's see the replay shortly.
themichaelowen,Red? Did he touch him? Looked a poor decision to me.

themichaelowen,"@silkysidd: @themichaelowen how about a retrospective panel with lengthy match bans? #diving

Were they dives? Both players got touched."
themichaelowen,"Both players were touched but IMO, as with most fouls, both players could have stayed on their feet. What's the correct decision then?"

themichaelowen,Criticism bit harsh on Scotland. Would of beat Wales if linesman was watching the game and no shame getting beat 2-0 in Belgium.
themichaelowen,Spain and Germany are different class at the minute. Way ahead of any other European nation.

themichaelowen,"Huge fan of Baines and I love how unselfish Welbeck is. Decent performance, no more than that. Game on Tuesday is a big one."
themichaelowen,I think the commentators have been over critical of England's performance. Trying to break through an 11 man back line is not that simple.
themichaelowen,This German team is different class. Can't remember the last time Ireland got thrashed on their own patch.
themichaelowen,"Was it a penalty? Yes
My point exactly."
themichaelowen,"Could Welbeck of stayed on his feet? Yes
Should he if someone wants to throw himself in front of him? No
Does that mean it was a dive? No"
themichaelowen,My statement in the week regarding penalties looks pretty accurate now. Maybe more than 75%!

tomorrow! Have a nice day everyone."

don't condone it and I think it should be stamped out of the game."
themichaelowen,"It is an art for an attacking player to entice a defender to make a wrong 
decision."
themichaelowen,"Very few tackles are delivered with the force required to knock somebody off their 
feet."
themichaelowen,"If that is wrong then virtually every foul that is seen on a football field is 
wrong."
themichaelowen,"As Pierluigi Collina said yesterday, ""If touched and fouled, a player has every 
right to go to ground."""
themichaelowen,"This is a regular occurrence in every league in the World. In two separate World 
Cups against Argentina, this was the case."
themichaelowen,"I have, however, gone down, WHEN FOULED, when I could have stayed on my feet."
themichaelowen,"To clarify, I have never won a penalty through diving and didn't say so 
yesterday, despite what the headlines say."
themichaelowen,To have a headline saying: Owen 'I dived to win a penalty' is disgraceful.
themichaelowen,"Final word on yesterday. Not for the first time, I feel a bit let down by the 
British press.

themichaelowen,"better than you were that because they were on performance enhancing drugs. No recognition, little reward etc. I'd be mortified."
themichaelowen,This Lance Armstrong stuff is unbelievable. Imagine dedicating your life to something and finding out that everybody that you thought were
themichaelowen,No better feeling than getting home and checking that my 4 little angels are fast asleep in their bunk beds before hitting the sack myself!
themichaelowen,@piersmorgan I actually just watched that and couldn't help but feel sorry for you. You weren't born to play sport were you?
themichaelowen,"@piersmorgan Anyway, why are you trying to talk football? You know as much about the game as I do about what you got up to as a News Editor."
themichaelowen,@piersmorgan big difference between going down when touched and when not touched. I have never done the latter as that is cheating / diving.
themichaelowen,"@piersmorgan You are changing your tune now lardy. Another clever journo trick. Stop wriggling, you have already made 1 false accusation."
themichaelowen,@piersmorgan and thus proves my point. You have just quoted me yet I've never said those words in my life. Typical. #clueless
themichaelowen,@piersmorgan I get it 100% fat chops. And that is that you and plenty more like you are the scum of the earth. Night Night.
themichaelowen,really are struggling to understand the game! I repeat I've never gone down and won a penalty without being touched as that would be diving!
themichaelowen,"Oh, and by the way, if you can't see for yourself that I could of stayed on my feet against Argentina without me having to say it then you"
themichaelowen,Just arriving at Chester Station. Been a long old day. Another one on the cards tomorrow. Training and then appearing on Question of Sport.
themichaelowen,then the comments they are sensationalising would appear towards the end of the article below the more important points.
themichaelowen,idea whatsoever about the game being in a position to fire out news that is a sideshow to what was said. If they did understand football
themichaelowen,"And so the sensationalising has begun (as predicted). Shame you can't have a good, honest debate in this country without people who have no"
themichaelowen,@OllieHolt22 My point is that every sport has its issues. Footballs current tweeting and diving issues seem like small fry compared to that!
themichaelowen,Didn't think you had it in you to fill another pram @WayneRooney !!! Still a couple behind me! Congratulations to you both.
themichaelowen,@OllieHolt22 Hate to harp on but imagine if he was a footballer? I feel for every other cyclists who now get tarnished with the same brush.
themichaelowen,"Anyway, have to admit I'm nervous about how tomorrow's news will be reported. Never nice to read things about yourself that you never said."
themichaelowen,I think it's falling over or diving without being touched to con the referee that most people want stamped out.
themichaelowen,I have to agree. I've earned penalties in 2 World Cups both against Argentina where I was touched yet could of stayed up if I had tried.
themichaelowen,"Legendary ref, P.Collina says a player has every right to go down if touched provided that player doesn't use an unnatural stride to trip."
themichaelowen,Very rarely does someone hit you with such force that it causes you to hit the deck. But where do you draw the line on whether it's a dive?
themichaelowen,Diving high on the agenda. I suggested at least 75% of players that go down for a penalty could have actually stayed on their feet.
themichaelowen,"My guard is up! Only 2 topics on everybody's lips today and once again, footballers actions were under fire. http://t.co/odypQl5C"

themichaelowen,@JohnnyMurtagh May not matter now with Kaymer. Tiger not in the invincible mindset any more. Molinari may gift him it here though.
themichaelowen,@GeoffCameron You are right. Won't matter though as Kaymer will close it out first!

themichaelowen,@AlastairCurtis We have come this far so we may as well go all the way!
themichaelowen,Wow! The yanks are human on the greens. Never has the importance of putting been so obvious.
themichaelowen,This Furyk putt is huge.

I agree. Monty was unbelievable."
themichaelowen,'@DietmarHamann Correct. Most people knew he was the winning Captain but now everybody does. Mentioned it 679 times and counting.
themichaelowen,make you think he would put a cork in it for two minutes. I don't think Europe are out of this just yet.

themichaelowen,"Tiger is obviously struggling. I said that after his first tee shot on Thursday! Monty, however, seems to have it right in for him."

themichaelowen,@brucemillington can't argue with that. His Ryder Cup record is up there with the best of them.
themichaelowen,@brucemillington I've no idea myself. Not much between the sides so Europe at 7-4 looks pretty big to me.

themichaelowen,@theclsum @markwynne2 @weezeowen @sumsumner @hayleywynne @lesleypartridge Reliving today. Karen's swipe that put her on her arse was tops!!!
themichaelowen,@sarahjbellman You are more than welcome if you are in the area Mrs B!
themichaelowen,Decent forecast today. The BBQ is making its belated return to action this afternoon.
themichaelowen,"Loving this. England looking lively. Runners from midfield, pace in our passing and when we lose the ball we are hunting in packs."
themichaelowen,Just seen @SkySportsNews. Typical that they showed me at the point of exhaustion having just finished the bleep test!!!

themichaelowen,@brucemillington That'll do nicely!!!
themichaelowen,Some ridiculous quotes doing the rounds on Twitter. I've not said anything of the like.
themichaelowen,Baptism of fire in training today! Legs are stiff now but the club were happy with my level of fitness. May be ready sooner than expected!

themichaelowen,"@RealJoeCalzaghe Cheers pal, not ready to retire just yet!"

themichaelowen,@PaddyBrennan22 Ta Paddy
themichaelowen,Thanks for your kind messages everyone. Can't wait to get going again!
themichaelowen,I'm now looking forward to contributing as much as possible to the club and can't wait to play in front of a great set of supporters.
themichaelowen,to join. I'm particularly excited at the prospect of working under Tony Pulis. He has assembled a great squad that I look forward to joining
themichaelowen,Delighted to have signed for Stoke subject to Premier League approval. We have been in talks for a while and it was a club I was always keen

themichaelowen,@JohnMartinComic Waiting for the joke! Not like you to praise me!
themichaelowen,Decent game so far. Liverpool pressing but Arsenal looking dangerous on the counter attack.
themichaelowen,@lesleypartridge @terryowenjr @rpart1 I have to admit that I'm a shocking singer. Get a few down me and I will think I'm great again though!
themichaelowen,@jamosfoundation I've resorted to playing Solitaire on my iPad!
themichaelowen,"@themichaelowen Saying that, Gary Barlow seems sound as does Dermot O'Leary but the rest is rancid!"
themichaelowen,Ended up watching the first act on X Factor which has just confirmed my feelings towards this shocking show.
themichaelowen,Obviously can't tell you who I'm in talks with yet. I have an idea where I will go but you never know who else could enter the fray!
themichaelowen,Reading my timeline. 99% of people asking where I will be playing next. I know who is interested but nothing will be done until next week.
themichaelowen,Time to exit the lounge. My girls want The X Factor on and I hate it with a passion. Could be an early night for me. Super Sunday awaits.
themichaelowen,Group 2 victory in Turkey to go with a winner at Chester. Manor House Stables is flying. Well done @TomDascombe @RKingscote and MHS Team.
themichaelowen,@brucemillington Not if you backed Masamah!
themichaelowen,"@SumSumner In fairness, it's not easy to replace Modric. He was top notch."
themichaelowen,Not a bad debut for Fletcher at Sunderland! I think they have bought well this summer.
themichaelowen,Lots of you asking about my next club. Genuinely don't know yet. Spoken to a few clubs. I'd expect something to happen early next week.
themichaelowen,"@Tripunovski: @themichaelowen berbatov and kagawa

I'd agree with that. Berba is a bargain and Kagawa looks class."
themichaelowen,Not sure about some of you saying Spurs have done best. The players they have brought in will do well to match the players that they lost.
themichaelowen,What team have recruited best in the window and who was the best value for money buy?
themichaelowen,@jamosfoundation Hangeland must have shrunk then as he was huge last time I played against him. Before you say it everyone looks huge to me!
themichaelowen,Pardon the pun but it's horses for courses. Carroll is a top player when in a team playing a direct style with crosses coming into the box.

themichaelowen,Just heard the news about one of my favourite players when I was growing up. Best wishes for a speedy recovery to Kevin Sheedy #getwellsoon
themichaelowen,Used to switch the TV off after a game. Now I like the analysis as much as the game. @skysports_ed and @GNev2 are different class.
themichaelowen,"@Ironfist2: @themichaelowen Who do you support michael? Serious question that I hope u have the balls to reply to""

The teams I've played 4"
themichaelowen,Great game. Not many teams will win at Goodison this season if that's anything to go by. United will no doubt be back with a bang.
themichaelowen,@piersmorgan You are a brave man Large Undies. Somehow I think he will have the last laugh.
themichaelowen,Jagielka hasn't done bad tonight either! Man U starting to hit top gear. #greatgame

It's an honour to be your 1000th tweet!"
themichaelowen,"As I said, he's a proper player. Thought it all last year and tonight is further confirmation. He looks slim, how is he so strong? #Fellaini"
themichaelowen,"'@Joey7Barton I've told you Quifford, don't even mention hairstyles with your pathetic effort up top."
themichaelowen,Reckon @GNev2 has been reading my tweets before analysing the first half! #talkingsense
themichaelowen,@piersmorgan Cheers large undies.
themichaelowen,Great to see Vidic back. He worked his nuts off to get back fit.
themichaelowen,Loving the fact that De Gea is silencing his doubters. Will make more mistakes in his career but people too quick to criticise last year.
themichaelowen,It's 'thoughts' @piersmorgan: Thought are with you @themichaelowen - can't be easy seeing Van Persie sitting in your old seat. #Benchwarmer
themichaelowen,Still 0-0 but it's a cracking game. Some proper players on show but none better than Fellaini. The guy is on fire. Strong as an Ox.
themichaelowen,"@rushy2009: @themichaelowen Are you signing  for Everton or is it just not true come on spill the  beans

Just rumours."

themichaelowen,@jamosfoundation Yes mate. Been on the road for 8 hours but well worth it!

themichaelowen,Liking your piece @Joey7Barton and agree with it in the main. All I would say is that it's not a very fair comparison.

True. I remember a few bad examples set in the Olympics too."
themichaelowen,I'm a huge fan of all of our Olympians but I struggle to understand the low opinion most people have towards footballers.

themichaelowen,@DietmarHamann Would you be able to get the bar past your nose?
themichaelowen,@chubby6665 Couldn't of made a worse start! Long way to go.
themichaelowen,@chubby6665 Been watching it for the last hour! Sensational!!!
themichaelowen,Not that confident but looks a good bet to me at 7-4. Taylor regularly goes for cover on T19's whereas Wade tends to stay up top on T20's.
themichaelowen,A great day of sport is about to end on a high with the final of the Darts! I'm having a bet on Wade to hit more 180's than Taylor!
themichaelowen,"@StarSports_Bet Well done lads. He has run well on every start for you. Very genuine. Pleased for you all, just a shame he didn't win!"
themichaelowen,@DietmarHamann But more decisions will be correct as a consequence.

themichaelowen,"@Joey7Barton Just seen your interview on @SkySports. You coat, glasses and hairstyle are all shambolic! Have you forgot your roots?"

themichaelowen,Doubt we have the type of players to do that though. Answer has to be to start coaching our youngsters a different brand of football.
themichaelowen,to find an alternative way to win. The other option is to forget results for a while and start from scratch playing a different style.
themichaelowen,We played to our strengths but are just not quite good enough. We were hoping to 'do a Chelsea'. If you are not the best team then you have

themichaelowen,"Now come on England, make it a day to remember!"
themichaelowen,"Big relief that the Panther is back. Well done @bertthebold @TomDascombe Andy, Chris, Marie, Colin and all the team at Manor House Stables."
themichaelowen,Hope you were all on! #brownpanther http://t.co/3fOfrFMI
themichaelowen,Nothing I've seen has made me change my mind. Spain to win it beating either England or Germany in the final.
themichaelowen,I'm fancying Spain to beat France tonight.
themichaelowen,Excited about tomorrow. Brown Panther returns in a Listed race at Pontefract.
themichaelowen,"@aaowen We will never know but I'm saying a definite length. I agree though, bit of an anticlimax. Great atmosphere before the race."
themichaelowen,Hate comparisons as they are different animals running over different distances but give me Frankel every time.
themichaelowen,My guess is that she would of won by 1 1/2 lengths if she had been pushed out by the jockey.
themichaelowen,Drama! What was the jockey doing???
themichaelowen,Can't wait for this race. I hate seeing Champions get beat so I'm hoping Black Caviar puts in a performance like Frankel on Tuesday.
themichaelowen,Premier Steps 3rd in The Albany. I think we have a very good bunch of 2 year old fillies at Manor House Stables!
themichaelowen,@donaldmccain He is a belter isn't he? Jumper in the making?!!!!!
themichaelowen,"Boooooooooooom!
Good old Paddy Partridge - hope you were all on!"
themichaelowen,"Paddy Partridge 2:20 Market Rasen
Third Half 6:25 Newmarket
Come on the brothers!"
themichaelowen,Royal Ascot again today but I'm hoping to have a winner or two at Market Rasen and Newmarket with Brown Panthers older and younger brothers!
themichaelowen,@bertthebold TV puts weight on everyone mate. I can vouch for that!
themichaelowen,@skysports_ed Thanks Ed.

themichaelowen,@terryowenjr @lavvo1 @woodsy_mark @terryowensnr @rpart1 Can't bloody wait!!!
themichaelowen,"Loving the pundits on ITV. Carra, Keane, Southgate - good team!"
themichaelowen,"This is starting to look interesting. If we avoid Spain and play Italy, I for one may start getting excited about our chances."
themichaelowen,Striker was offside leading up to that 'not given goal' but the save by Hart and clearance by Terry were sensational!
themichaelowen,@Trinity_Elite It was a great day. Thanks again for all your support.
themichaelowen,Confirmation that to employ extra officials behind the goals is a total waste of time....But I'm not complaining!
themichaelowen,I was there! #wow #frankel http://t.co/ONrISEn7
themichaelowen,Royal Ascot is upon us. Good luck to everyone involved.
themichaelowen,@rpart1 You are a tool.

themichaelowen,@OwenGemma Thanks special girl. X
themichaelowen,Loving my US Open Bets! Westwood (12-1) and Furyk (33-1) right in the mix. Rose (33-1) got an outside chance too. 5 each way on each!!!
themichaelowen,"Really good night and nice to earn some money for our local charity, 'Chester Child Birth Appeal' for which @WeezeOwen and I are Patrons."
themichaelowen,Just on the train heading home from London. Me and @WeezeOwen just filmed 'Mr and Mrs' to be shown in the Autumn. #goodlaugh
themichaelowen,I'm sure Hodgson has it all planned out. 5 points should qualify out of our Group so a draw wouldn't be a disaster. Come on England!
themichaelowen,"against inferior teams, if you get the system wrong and lose the midfield battle then you are in trouble at this level."
themichaelowen,manager will change the system against a top team. Just hope we haven't underestimated the Swedes. The last World Cup proved that even

themichaelowen,I've asked so many people 'in the know' about it and everyone says that inswingers are a killer to defend. #baffled
themichaelowen,Outswinging corners. Can somebody please tell me how they are as effective as inswingers? Why do so many teams persist with them?
themichaelowen,Don't fancy brushing my teeth this morning! Strange how I live in a county famous for its water yet I get given this. http://t.co/lggc4j6U
themichaelowen,@AdamDandy @weezeowen @markwynne2 Not much changes there then!
themichaelowen,"Time to watch The US Open. Had a few bets to give me something to cheer. Furyk, Westwood, McCilroy, Rose."
themichaelowen,Imagine how loud the Irish fans would be if they had something to shout about! #properfans
themichaelowen,@markwynne2 I'm running out of patience! I attended his school tournament for 2 hours today and couldn't face any more!
themichaelowen,Do these commentators know the rules? Level with the last man is ONSIDE.
themichaelowen,@RichardThomas19 otherwise engaged in London this weekend sorry.
themichaelowen,Iniesta is a genius. Doesn't get enough recognition being in the same club side as Messi. He is my prediction for Player of the Tournament.
themichaelowen,@DLA1972 The Former!!!!
themichaelowen,Has there ever been so many managerial changes during a summer before?
themichaelowen,Been in meetings all day. Just got home. Sounds like I've missed 2 good games and what's the news on Harry leaving Spurs?
themichaelowen,@RKingscote @laurencebellman You won on the wrong horse - I didn't back Julius Geezer!
themichaelowen,Shevchenko - what a Legend.
themichaelowen,Definitely take that. Important not to get beat today. 5 points should get you out of our Group.
themichaelowen,"What a ball by Stevie G. Always fancy Lescott, brave as a lion when it comes to sticking his head in where it hurts."
themichaelowen,Getting closer to training @WayneRooney a winner! Pippy just came 2nd at Folkestone.
themichaelowen,Modric is a joy to watch.
themichaelowen,@TmagBoothypro @terryowenjr No but I will once the football finishes! Is there anything on tomorrow? Was thinking of having a game.
themichaelowen,Get in. Come on Ireland!
themichaelowen,Unbelievable line up for Spain. No striker playing. This could end up looking like a training ground game of possession.
themichaelowen,@Joey7Barton Didn't see it myself.
themichaelowen,@donaldmccain Just got home. Missing Portugal already!
themichaelowen,Holiday over. Fly back home this morning. Time to hit the gym and start getting ready for Pre Season - wherever that may be!!!
themichaelowen,Bradley beats Pacquiao on a split decision. At last this weight division may not be as strong as it was. Time for @AmirKingKhan to clean up.
themichaelowen,@OllieHoltMirror Good start for your Golden Boot fancy!
themichaelowen,@GaryLineker Messi has doubters? I've heard many ridiculous things in my life but who on this earth can doubt him?
themichaelowen,@OllieHoltMirror @dickinsontimes Tough Group but I can see there being a few high scoring games in it. Fancy our Group to be low scoring.
themichaelowen,.@OllieHoltMirror @dickinsontimes I'd go for RVP.
themichaelowen,.@DickinsonTimes Champions League Final. For them reasons I fail to see how they are challenging Spain for favouritism.
themichaelowen,".@DickinsonTimes I rate them highly but they are suspect at the back, in the toughest Group and many of their players are pig sick after the"
themichaelowen,Surprised a few of you aren't having Nani as a player. The fella has got talent like you would not believe.
themichaelowen,"As I've said, I'm going for Spain with Holland as my 2nd pick. Obviously my heart says England though!"
themichaelowen,People question where Spain's goals will come from but how will the other team score when they hardly ever touch the ball?
themichaelowen,Any team with Ronaldo and Nani in it has to be feared. I rate Germany but can't have it that they are joint favs with Spain.
themichaelowen,What a sporting day in store. Looking forward to the Germany v Portugal game in particular.
themichaelowen,Holiday X Factor auditions! http://t.co/56mEQoFe
themichaelowen,Two good games to start the Euros today. Not seen Arshavin play like that for a while! I'm still siding with Spain or Holland to win it.
themichaelowen,Fantastic @missymurf12. What a ride and what a willing partner! Delighted for you. Well trained @TomDascombe. #Manorhousestables
themichaelowen,Is there a left back playing for Greece? Every attack is coming down the right. Greece manager needs to change things quick!!!

themichaelowen,"Yeeees!!! The lads horse just won. Take a bow J.Kington. Winning owners: O'Shea, Giggs, Scholes, Butt, Carrick, W.Brown, G.Nev and Me!"
themichaelowen,Main debate remains. Who plays wide? Rest of the team picks itself injuries permitting.
themichaelowen,@_PaulHayward We have to. Don't play with fire. Play to our strengths. Defend well and nick a goal. We would be tough to beat doing that.
themichaelowen,Said it before the game and still have the same belief. Welbeck to start v France with Young in behind until Rooney returns from his ban.
themichaelowen,@_PaulHayward I agree but we have more chance playing that way than being expansive.
themichaelowen,@Atkinsonross Well done kidder.
themichaelowen,@JackWilshere #pace!
themichaelowen,"England v France.
Hart
Johnson Terry Cahill Cole
? Parker Gerrard ?
Young Welbeck
Who do you think will play wide?"
themichaelowen,Italy got stuffed 3-0 last night. My tip for Ireland to get out of their group at 4-1 looks even more tempting now!
themichaelowen,No surprise if Welbeck starts for England today. I think he will start against France with Young in behind.
themichaelowen,@1stServePromo @tomdascombe Well done Nigel and Shaz - he looks like a future winner!!

themichaelowen,@Atkinsonross I text @TomDascombe and @mattykwilliams straight after the race saying the same thing!
themichaelowen,Are the rumours that RVP has signed a new contract at Arsenal true? Best signing of the summer so far if they are.
themichaelowen,Brendan Rodgers to Liverpool. Could be a good bit of business. Looking forward to next seasons Premier League already!
themichaelowen,Ireland at 4-1 to get out of the group looks good. Not a huge fan of Italy at present. Spain look certainties to win that group.
themichaelowen,Essential you don't lose your first game in a tournament. Not great that we have drawn a top team in France to play first.
themichaelowen,England appointing a new manager has increased our chances. A couple of good results and momentum will gather. We will know our fate early!
themichaelowen,I like Germany's chances but 3-1? Not for me. Holland at 7-1 look good value. I'm going for them or Spain to win it.
themichaelowen,Been studying the Euro 2012 prices this afternoon. Can anybody tell me how Germany are priced up the same as Spain at 3-1?

themichaelowen,@_PaulHayward @ollieholtmirror Sounds minor but they are so painful. I'm sure he would be out there if he could.
themichaelowen,@OllieHoltMirror I agree. I thought Lescott too.
themichaelowen,@OllieHoltMirror nobody in particular. I'm confident about the 4 I mentioned but there is always a surprise or two.
themichaelowen,@_PaulHayward I'd say so. Pretty confident about them 4 but there is bound to be a surprise in there too.
themichaelowen,I wonder how many of tonight's starting 11 will start the first game against France. Can't decide between 4 and 5.
themichaelowen,Great goal by Young. Slightly scuffed the finish but amazing how many times a scuff finds the corners!
themichaelowen,"Looking forward to tonight. I'm going for a low scoring game, possibly 1-0 to England. I have a bit of new found belief under Hodgson."
themichaelowen,@missymurf12 He ran great!

themichaelowen,Delighted for Torres. Taken loads of stick. Great for English football to have a team in the final.
themichaelowen,Wow!!! Great composure. Can't believe how Chelsea have turned this round. Can't imagine I was the only one thinking they were out at HT!
themichaelowen,Unbelievable performance from Chelsea. I didn't give them a chance with 10 men but they have defended heroically!
themichaelowen,Chelsea showing plenty of character but still can't see them hanging on with only 10 men.
themichaelowen,Bolton 2-1 up at Villa. If it stays like that Villa could be in trouble.
themichaelowen,Lost count of how many times an English team has been knocked out of a big tournament due to ill discipline.
themichaelowen,That is some finish from a top player but I can't see it making much difference.
themichaelowen,Game set and match.
themichaelowen,Not original but I can see Barca winning tonight and booking their place in the final to play Madrid.

themichaelowen,"Fair play to the commentators, they said Barca will struggle on set pieces. Only 1 outfield player 6ft or over? I bet Chelsea are watching!"
themichaelowen,Spain have at least 5 of the top 10 keepers in the world. How is your luck being the worlds 2nd best keeper and earning half a dozen caps!
themichaelowen,I hope my old team get a result but I think Barca will beat them. There could be more red cards than goals!

themichaelowen,Not many teams go to Arsenal and pass it around like that. Takes a lot of belief in yourself and trust in your teammates to do that.
themichaelowen,Wigan were different class last night. No fluke about the result. Couldn't believe the courage they showed to play the way they did.
themichaelowen,That result last night changes things down at the bottom. Who do you fancy for relegation now? What an end to the season we have in store.
themichaelowen,Bad news for England as @JackWilshere is forced to miss the Euros.

themichaelowen,@LaurenceBellman it's not football Lol. Don't have to play away if you don't want to. Not a happy bunny today as you can tell.

themichaelowen,@_PaulHayward Good news for me and the few players I've backed as I didn't fancy a Round 3 Tiger surge!
themichaelowen,Another defeat for Wolves. That's 6 on the bounce. Not looking good for them. Great to see their fans clapping them off at the end though.
themichaelowen,Can't wait for The Masters tonight but this limited coverage that Sky are contracted to show is a killer.

themichaelowen,"RT @TomDascombe: ""@tomclevz23 Brazilian clown, jessie B, golden pursuit and out of the blocks #winners"" The 4 Olympic horses are named!  ..."
themichaelowen,"That penalty kept us in the tie. Fair play to Bilbao, they are a good side and played well tonight."
themichaelowen,@stevepalmer78 Agree. Had 3 or 4 ante post bets so far. Hurricane Fly looks to be one of the bankers.
themichaelowen,Great stuff @LaurenceBellman and @RKingscote another winner for @TomDascombe and all at Manor House Stables.
themichaelowen,@stevepalmer78 Followed your advice this week and had a dabble ew on Dustin Johnson. Looking to boost my Cheltenham kitty!!!!
themichaelowen,Not old enough to see some of the greats but I can't believe anyone can have played the game of football as well as Messi.

themichaelowen,@GeoffShreeves Ha Ha! I will be happy if I have your waistline when I hit 50!
themichaelowen,Plenty of top quality entries so far at #looksjustlike. My shortlist is turning into a longlist but keep them coming!

themichaelowen,.@ffrantic Bit dodgy that one! Can just about see what he means...#looksjustlike
themichaelowen,Remember that the #looksjustlike doesn't have to be famous - just needs to look like a famous sports person.
themichaelowen,.@Iwanrunner Now that #looksjustlike! although you used the wrong hashtag!
themichaelowen,Here's one for starters. Jo-Wilfried Tsonga #looksjustlike Muhammad Ali http://t.co/5qRZtTs5

themichaelowen,To enter just tweet a photo of your lookalike and don't forget to use the hashtag #looksjustlike with your entry!
themichaelowen,After the @umbro fun with lookalikes last week I've decided to do a competition to find the best sports person lookalike #looksjustlike
themichaelowen,Trademark Ashley Young. What a nice finish.
themichaelowen,"Great finish. Come on lads, see it out. #hugeresult"
themichaelowen,Get in. Huge goal.
themichaelowen,Relegation scrap starting to take shape. Bad results for Wigan and Bolton. Starting to fear for them. Still time to turn things round though
themichaelowen,Didn't think Liverpool deserved to lose today but just shows how important it is to have a striker banging them in. Van Persie is on fire.
themichaelowen,Must run in the family as 2 of the kids were bed hopping last night. I woke up with my son in the bed but no wife!
themichaelowen,Up early. Bad dream and couldn't get back to sleep! Why do bad dreams still scare me until it goes light in the morning?
themichaelowen,"RT @GaryLineker: @themichaelowen 
Never worry about expressing your view and never ever worry about inflammatory headlines. It is what t ..."
themichaelowen,"Reassuringly, and from reading your tweets, the vast majority of you seem to 
agree."
themichaelowen,"So, to reaffirm my point, getting beat at Wembley and many people accepting 
it as if it was expected didn't feel right to me."
themichaelowen,"By doing so, they get to fill their paper for a couple of days and in doing 
so short change their readers with a total 'non story'."
themichaelowen,Typical of the British Media. Invent a quote to create a storm and then fill the paper with experts slamming me for things I never said.
themichaelowen,"Having read them, can somebody please tell me how I can be quoted as saying 'England Flopped'?"
themichaelowen,Have we slipped that far behind other teams that people now accept getting beat so long as we 'show some pride'? I hope not.
themichaelowen,"I mean, it's hardly like we played brilliant and were unlucky to lose. No matter what team is out there, losing has to be frowned upon."
themichaelowen,"Surprised at the reaction after last nights match. Experimental team or not, surely getting beat at Wembley is disappointing?"
themichaelowen,"I stand by what I said and for clarity, these are the Tweets I posted 
yesterday:"
themichaelowen,"Astonished to wake up to this headline this morning until I realised the 
Newspaper responsible. http://t.co/fanNK1CF"
themichaelowen,"@piersmorgan You have not done bad yourself considering you are talentless. Over and out, bored of you now."
themichaelowen,"@piersmorgan and just to confirm, I never criticised any player or manager whereas you do it every single time your mob play. Hypocrite????"
themichaelowen,"@piersmorgan Thanks for stating the obvious. I only trained for the first time today. Even so, I'd suggest I'm in better condition than you."
themichaelowen,The Darts is starting to hot up. Anderson v Lewis looks to be the game of the night. Predictions? I'm siding with Lewis.
themichaelowen,Ha Ha! Loving that. Few of you tweeting to say he was the fella who bottled it when Carra rang up the show!!! Priceless. That says it all.
themichaelowen,"Just to confirm, I stand by what I said. We should never be happy losing at Wembley. We are England and have top players for crying out loud"
themichaelowen,@piersmorgan I normally find you funny but you really are embarrassing yourself tonight.
themichaelowen,People on Talksport crawl around for Interviews all the time which I've agreed to many times and and then they hammer you on air! #classy
themichaelowen,Who did he play for or is he another nobody that gets a bit of publicity for slating people? It's a funny old world we live in.
themichaelowen,"Must admit, I've never listened to Talksport so I don't know who this Adrian something is who has apparently had a pop at me."
themichaelowen,@piersmorgan You would know a thing or two about twisting words. #journo
themichaelowen,@piersmorgan Would never hammer fellow players. I was merely questioning the views of many experts' assessment of the game.
themichaelowen,I hope he ends up as good!!! http://t.co/tZxOIN8H
themichaelowen,Have we slipped that far behind other teams that people now accept getting beat so long as we 'show some pride'? I hope not.

themichaelowen,.@umbro @waynerooney Not seen him all day! #lookalike ?
themichaelowen,@RichardThomas19 God knows but I keep getting linked to Championship teams. I've obviously lost the respect of some people!
themichaelowen,Rumour mill never ceases to amaze. Where do they come from? And why do I keep getting linked to other clubs? Free publicity for them maybe?
themichaelowen,"Just started reading my timeline. Where have all these rumours come from? Bursting my balls to get back playing, not to stop playing!!!"

themichaelowen,I have a feeling our physio has a tough day planned for me today. Always makes me pay for having a Sunday off!
themichaelowen,Was good to see Arsenal back in top form. Seems like there has been a lot of negativity around the club for a while.
themichaelowen,Well done Theo Walcott yesterday. I wonder if those abusing him had the audacity to celebrate his two goals?
themichaelowen,My My My. #Messi
themichaelowen,I think Messi just edges it for me but I reckon Ronaldo would be as good as he is in any team whereas I'm not so sure that Messi would be.
themichaelowen,"The debate has been done to death but who would you have, Messi or Ronaldo? Surely the best two players ever to play the game?"
themichaelowen,.@DaveClarkTV Crawl out from under her thumb Dave! My Mrs is upstairs watching Dancing On Ice or something. Sunday = sport on tv. #happydays
themichaelowen,Anyone seen Ronaldo's goal today for Madrid? Unbelievable back heel. The lad is a goal machine.
themichaelowen,"Right then, need to put the kids to bed, watch the golf, watch Barca and then hit it hard this week in training to get fit."
themichaelowen,Surprising Suarez never took a pen. Nobody likes doing it but I thought he would take the responsibility to take one.
themichaelowen,"Carra's lad, James, will be the star of the show when he goes to school tomorrow!"
themichaelowen,Never seen the target missed so much in a penalty shoot out. #greatfinal
themichaelowen,Tom Heaton was at United. He is a good lad. Him or Reina about to earn hero status.
themichaelowen,Cardiff won semi final on pens so may have some confidence. Liverpool have better players and one of the best penalty savers in the world.
themichaelowen,Wow. Penalties here we come.
themichaelowen,@RKingscote @atkinsonross My clobber is top class and you know it. Just wait to see me at the races this summer.
themichaelowen,@Atkinsonross @rkingscote Doubt he would accept. Have you not seen Richards gear?
themichaelowen,First observation - Kenny should be wearing a suit.
themichaelowen,Great article in The Mail today by @GNev2
themichaelowen,The man is a Legend! Just when we need someone to produce - Giggsy bags the winner!
themichaelowen,Wow. Giggsy hits 900 games for United if he appears today. Phenomenal. Will that ever be beaten? I doubt it.

themichaelowen,What a game this has been. Could of been 15-1 but for the Keeper. #Barca
themichaelowen,This Valencia cat is on fire.
themichaelowen,Barca are in the zone tonight. What a game so far.
themichaelowen,Majority of the big teams get home advantage in the FA Cup draw.
themichaelowen,Anyone see that Burnley defender stick his head in there to stop a goal? Could of got his head kicked off. Bravest defending I've ever seen.
themichaelowen,Wow! That deserves another tweet! Taylor just hit a 9 darter. #arrers

themichaelowen,"Well, not the best of nights for English football. Time to watch some Snooker before I go to bed!"
themichaelowen,I say that in a day and age where we have some top class commentators and pundits. Just can't listen to a couple of them.

themichaelowen,"@piersmorgan Oh, Ha Ha Ha. Funny that one. Must look back in my archives to see if you have used that one before."
themichaelowen,If Arsenal can keep it to 2 they might have a chance at The Emirates. Easier said than done. The San Siro is as tough as it gets.

themichaelowen,@PaddyBrennan22 Congrats mate!
themichaelowen,Exactly the same can be said of John Arne Riise. 1 famous free kick against United but no others from 100 attempts. #freekickspecialists
themichaelowen,Not having the Roberto Carlos shouts. He scored 1 that sticks in everybody's but his conversion rate was poor. #freekickspecialists
themichaelowen,Juninho for Lyon / Brazil is a good shout. Mijatovic for Lazio was different class too. Them and Beckham are my top 3. #freekickspecialists
themichaelowen,@brucemillington I did!!!
themichaelowen,@GaryLineker_ I cried when that went in. Was only 11! You were at the height of your powers that tournament! I was you in the playground!!!
themichaelowen,"Or was Le Tissier known as Le God? Whichever it was, he gets my vote!!!"
themichaelowen,Give me some top free kick takers and we will debate it later!!! Beckham sticks out as the obvious one.
themichaelowen,Reliably informed that Molby scored 42 from 45. Le Tissier only missed 1 I think from 50 odd. No wonder he was called Le King!
themichaelowen,"Magilton, Harte and Gerrard are other good shouts. Right, I'm off to get ready to take my Mrs out for her Birthday."
themichaelowen,Anyone remember the penalty Kevin Pressley (Sheff Wed keeper) scored in a shoot out? Best ever! Thunderbolt right into the top corner!
themichaelowen,Forgot one! Big Jan Molby. Absolutely sensational. He is right up there with the best of them.
themichaelowen,"Looking at the list of people you are mentioning, I would have to say that Matt Le Tissier is the best I've seen."
themichaelowen,Few saying me! I had a good record for Newcastle and England but very average for Liverpool. Could never wrestle Zidane off them at Madrid!!
themichaelowen,Denis Irwin was top notch too. Man U have been blessed with some great penalty takers over the years.
themichaelowen,Chilavert - that's the one! Good shout people.
themichaelowen,"Some fair shouts. I agree with Ronaldo, Van Nistlerooy, Mendieta, Lampard, Shearer. Who was that South American keeper with a great record?"
themichaelowen,"He has to be one of the best ever penalty takers. Le Tissier, G.Alexander and J.Dicks are other top takers that spring to mind. Any others?"
themichaelowen,Just watched Cantonas Man Utd career goals on MUTV. He sends the keeper the wrong way on 99% of his penalties. Unbelievable.
themichaelowen,@DonaldsonJamie All progressing well. Should be joining in training with the team soon. I fancy you to win one of the next 4 tournaments!
themichaelowen,@DonaldsonJamie Nice final round on Sunday. Nice few quid / ranking points earned. Where are you next?

themichaelowen,@leejones_red Ha Ha! It's spoiling the game. Are you on a Super Sunday? The TV will look blurred to you by now regardless if you are!
themichaelowen,Not too happy with the kits on display here! Look a bit too similar on TV.
themichaelowen,I can't work Wolves out. They always win when I expect them to lose and they lose when I expect them to win.
themichaelowen,Come on Villa!!!
themichaelowen,"For those who missed it, he didn't take sides. He is suggesting the PFA step in to mediate between the two clubs for the good of football."
themichaelowen,"Looking at the league table, can't believe how well Norwich have done so far. Everton Swansea Newcastle and Sunderland also warrant a shout."
themichaelowen,"Fair play to Clarke Carlisle, our Chairman of The PFA. His interview on Sky Sports was very impressive."
themichaelowen,@danwalkerbbc You learn fast on here! Try to be honest but whatever you put upsets somebody. Pleased I kept quiet today!
themichaelowen,All very serious on here this evening! Not going to give my opinion on our game as I fancy a quiet night without millions of abusive tweets!
themichaelowen,Some big results today but none bigger than another Chester win! #comeonyouseals

themichaelowen,The World Champs were not just a flash in the pan. The Hammer looks like he belongs in the Worlds elite. #arrers
themichaelowen,"I'm going for Wade, Whitlock and Anderson to win tonight. Hard to choose a winner in the main event but may go for Lewis to beat Taylor."
themichaelowen,Do slim darts players exist by the way? I reckon a big gut must help for balance or something as all the top players have them!!!
themichaelowen,Gutted! I was doing my work in the gym. Was desperate to see who had the biggest belly!!!
themichaelowen,All the Premier League Darts players were at our training ground this morning with them playing in Manchester tonight and I missed them!
themichaelowen,@_PaulHayward @dickinsontimes I'm sure some will!
themichaelowen,@DickinsonTimes I've never been a creep!!!
themichaelowen,Just walked into the dressing room and Wazza shouted 'MO could be back in the England Squad' to which I replied 'why is my Dad taking over'!
themichaelowen,"Anyway, forget Redknapp and Capello, the big news today is that The Premier League of Darts is back on our screens tonight! #tvdynamite"
themichaelowen,Surely we will stick to an Englishman as our next manager. And that should run right through the squad from players to tea lady IMO.
themichaelowen,Don't know if was just me but it never felt right in the first place knowing the England Manager was heading off after the Euros regardless.
themichaelowen,Ever been such a strong public opinion when it comes to naming the next England manager? I don't know anyone that doesn't want Redknapp.
themichaelowen,@RKingscote Sensational stuff.
themichaelowen,"Wow, only just seen the news. Capello resigns."

themichaelowen,Just started reading Didi Hamann's book. Funniest man in football and one of my big mates. Definitely recommend it.
themichaelowen,"@piersmorgan @garylineker_ Don't need to Lardy. He scored 48 goals for England, end of story."
themichaelowen,@GaryLineker_ No surprise to see that you have been on Twitter a week and Big Breasts has already started spouting his rubbish at you.

themichaelowen,Great to read your timeline after a game like that. The highs and lows of football hey! What a game.
themichaelowen,@piersmorgan they have no clue about in front of millions of people. Football is full of it.
themichaelowen,@piersmorgan And that's the problem in this world. Clueless people like you somehow get in a position to be able to talk about something
themichaelowen,@piersmorgan only in America could somebody like you be asked to go on tv to talk about football.
themichaelowen,"@piersmorgan pundit maybe but please, you, an 'expert'. Do us all a favour."
themichaelowen,Great to hear todays game is not in doubt due to the weather. Huge game for both teams. #SuperSunday

themichaelowen,"@LaurenceBellman You will get promoted mate, even if it's not pretty. I'm sure that will be the stock answer from your manager."
themichaelowen,@brucemillington I agree with that article. Not sure about them stickers but courses have every right to have a certain dress code.
themichaelowen,@LaurenceBellman I don't read tabloids any more mate and nor do lots of people now judged on their declining sales.
themichaelowen,only to repeat my tweet in ink. Maybe if he focused on the more pressing issues in sport I would of heard of him before now.
themichaelowen,given a couple of column inches a week yet feels its appropriate to use some of his precious space worrying about what I do in my spare time
themichaelowen,"He claims I should have better things to do than to tweet such rubbish. If that's the case, surely he contradicts himself as he only gets"
themichaelowen,I'm told some chap I've never met called Des Kelly aimed a cheap shot my way in one of today's papers for my fun tweet on Chocolate Bars.

themichaelowen,@Joey7Barton Got to have someone to argue with as I don't fancy trading insults with Iron Mike!!!
themichaelowen,Well done to our Youth Team beating Swansea 5-1. Through to the next round after a convincing performance. Great competition to win.
themichaelowen,"Just watched last years Cheltenham Gold Cup on RUK. Long Run, Kauto and Denman jumping the last together. Absolutely magical. What a race."

themichaelowen,@BarryJGeraghty Don't you have to keep your weight down?! Saw you ride a winner in the first today - well done.
themichaelowen,@piersmorgan You delved deep into your reserves to think that one up. #farfetchedbanter and don't use the word reserves for your next joke.
themichaelowen,.@GaryLineker_ Would never do that. Fond memories of doing that Walkers Ad together. Cheese n Owen - classic!
themichaelowen,@piersmorgan Sorry. Will you relieve the boredom for us and do some more of your really interesting Arsenal tweets please? #boreoff
themichaelowen,.@danwalkerbbc Boosts get a game but they are similar to Star Bars and the latter gets the nod.
themichaelowen,".@danwalkerbbc Yes, Crunchie crossed my mind. I eat them in a similar way to a Bounty. Bite chocolate off first, then muller the inside!!!"
themichaelowen,"Just remembered, our Youth Team play tonight on MUTV. Mrs Owen thought she was having a night without live sport on the tv! Shame!!!"
themichaelowen,".@danwalkerbbc Worse than that, it's in my bottom 3! Not a nougat fan."
themichaelowen,Any recommendations on what to watch tonight? Looked at Sky Sports and not too excited with what's on offer.

Least favourite:
1. Turkish Delight (hate the pink stuff!)
2. Mars Bar (boring)
3. Double Decker (not a nougat fan)"

themichaelowen,"Strangely, I prefer the chocolate in Minstrels but I'm siding with Maltesers."
themichaelowen,Quite a few Caramac shouts. Can see where you are coming from. Another thing I want answering. Maltesers or Minstrels?
themichaelowen,"My top 5: 
1. Picnic
2. Topic
3. Star Bar
4. Fruit and Nut
5. Ripple
Others in the running: Drifter, Wispa Gold, Toffee Crisp, Lion Bar."
themichaelowen,Can't believe there are so many Double Decker shouts. Not having that! Seems like loads of you like Wispa's too!
themichaelowen,Favourite Chocolate Bar past or present people? Had an argument with one of our physios today. His picks were so boring.

themichaelowen,"So, after a busy night, which team has fared best out of this transfer window? Everton and QPR spring to mind. West Ham not done bad either."
themichaelowen,Not as many transfers as this time last year. West Ham and QPR big movers. Wouldn't be deadline day if Spurs didn't do any business!!!
themichaelowen,What a night!
themichaelowen,@piersmorgan Not bad for you!!!
themichaelowen,Love transfer deadline day. Off to watch our match tonight then back home to catch up on all the movers and shakers!!!
themichaelowen,@DickinsonTimes then feed that image despite it sometimes being false.
themichaelowen,@DickinsonTimes a false impression of that person. That doesn't always happen I know but the press do like to form an image of people and
themichaelowen,@DickinsonTimes as opposed to an article that he / she and the editor feel will sell more papers not forgetting sometimes giving the reader
themichaelowen,@DickinsonTimes No it doesn't but surely it's a journalists responsibility to write an article containing views that person wants to express
themichaelowen,@Joey7Barton I wrote for the Times back in the day. Good paper.
themichaelowen,Just read @Joey7Barton piece about Twitter in today's Times. Sensational. It's a must read.

themichaelowen,Different handball rules in La Liga. They seem to give a free kick even if it's blasted at an arm from a yard away. And then they book them!

themichaelowen,@mickfitzg Nice article in the Post today mate. Your behaviour during your career was in keeping with most top sportsmen! #toughatthetop
themichaelowen,"Wow, what a finish. Shock on the cards?"
themichaelowen,"@piersmorgan Poor response. Admit defeat. More importantly, admit that you know nothing about sport and stop pretending you do."
themichaelowen,That's how to finish. Accuracy ahead of power. #sunderlandvboro
themichaelowen,@piersmorgan Not much. Only 15 years at the highest possible level with a pretty decent looking CV. You?
themichaelowen,@piersmorgan don't preach rubbish to everyone when you wouldn't know what it's like to break sweat - unless you were chasing a burger van.
themichaelowen,@piersmorgan Quick succession? You speak sense at times but please don't try to understand what it takes to be a sportsman and certainly
themichaelowen,@piersmorgan Typical rubbish being spouted again Piers. England Cricket Team didn't try did they not? Footballers refuse to play 2 games in

themichaelowen,"Oh, surprise surprise. Everybody expert on tv agrees with me including Jamie Redknapp. Can't remember who he used to play for. #biased?"
themichaelowen,Amazing how an honest opinion that most people agree with can ignite so much abuse. We live in a pretty average world people. Shame on you.
themichaelowen,@vickyhardie5 Very classy. Bet your Parents are very proud of their daughter.
themichaelowen,Amazing how biased some people are. I want Liverpool to win but still didn't think it was a pen.

themichaelowen,African football improving at a rate of knots but it's a struggle watching games in this African Nations Cup competition.

themichaelowen,"@RichardThomas19 Great. Massive pay day if they win tonight. Promotion beckons. Don't worry, Chester will be back in the league soon too!"

themichaelowen,You couldn't write it! Scholesy is a legend.
themichaelowen,@WeezeOwen Stop reading twitter and get on with watching your intellectual programme Big Brother. Home in 20 mins to watch my programmes!
themichaelowen,Looking at tomorrow's matches. Premier League games look too obvious or too close to call so I'm going for Leicester to beat Barnsley.
themichaelowen,Full marks to the FA. It's a great course and run by top people. Need to work hard to pass which is how it should be.
themichaelowen,My assessor will be happy!!! http://t.co/yAQvISXO
themichaelowen,Loving some of your advice on defending but don't think 'two foot tackle them and take a booking' will somehow earn me my qualification!
themichaelowen,@rcs82 love that! Reckon I will pass if I encourage that?!!!
themichaelowen,@JoceT22 Fitness coming on great thanks. You are at my fav race track in your photo. I may be in the background!

themichaelowen,@GormanColin and we pay for you to be out there!!! Swap jobs?!!!
themichaelowen,Great couple of days for football fans. Scholes and Henry back in business. What a season this has been so far.
themichaelowen,@piersmorgan Ha Ha. That's one thing I don't have to learn Lardy. Nobody knows where the onion bag is more than me!
themichaelowen,He just has it doesn't he? #henry
themichaelowen,Can't be long before Henry joins the action. I reckon he will still be the best player on the pitch even if he isn't quite as good as he was
themichaelowen,@Joey7Barton I don't respond. I just feel sorry for the people that enjoy that type of thing. They will grow up one day.
themichaelowen,"@Joey7Barton Am I one of the 12, 35, 100 or the rest?!!!"
themichaelowen,1st it was Scholes and tonight it's the turn of Henry. 2 of the all time great Premier League players returning in the space of 2 days! #wow
themichaelowen,@RichardThomas19 @lavvo1 @terryowenjr They are not allowed to go without me so you will be going alone!
themichaelowen,@RichardThomas19 @lavvo1 @terryowenjr Ain't no trip without me!
themichaelowen,@RichardThomas19 Few of us went last year. It was different class. Defo going again but no way you lot having a jolly up without me!!!
themichaelowen,Trying to get into watching NFL but there are just too many ad breaks. There are some serious athletes playing that game.
themichaelowen,@RichardThomas19 I wish! Give me a few years and we will make it an annual event!
themichaelowen,Didn't see that coming. Warnock been sacked by QPR.
themichaelowen,"@GormanColin Keep them sweet mate, can't wait to watch them run out there. MHS in Dubai - we are moving in the right direction!"
themichaelowen,And people talk about United always getting lucky cup draws!!! Couldn't get much tougher. What a game to look forward to.
themichaelowen,@LaurenceBellman how were they looking this weekend? I've not been up for a while. Can't wait to see the babies gallop.
themichaelowen,@LaurenceBellman Your mob just concentrating on the league?
themichaelowen,@piersmorgan Imagine how big your mouth would be if you had an ounce of his talent.
themichaelowen,@piersmorgan Scholes completed more passes in his brief appearance than any City player did in the whole game. #makesthingstick
themichaelowen,@piersmorgan And that's precisely why nobody are interested in your football related opinions. #clueless
themichaelowen,Hurts even more to be injured when you watch games like that. Can't wait to get back fit. Can't wait for the 4th round draw later either!
themichaelowen,"Some managers choose to criticise the officials but fair play to Mancini, despite the best efforts of the interviewer to get him in trouble."
themichaelowen,Some game. Great effort from the lads. I knew we wouldn't get beat today. The last 2 games hurt too much for it to happen for a 3rd game.
themichaelowen,The game of football never ceases to amaze.
themichaelowen,Wow. Penalty?
themichaelowen,This is magic. Scholes is back. What a legend.
themichaelowen,What a start. The lads were fired up for this one.
themichaelowen,Anybody seen that catch on Sky Sports News from a cricket game yesterday? Thats the best piece of cricket I've seen.
themichaelowen,Huge game today. Say no more!
themichaelowen,Gillette Soccer Saturday is quality. How can a programme just reporting on goals being scored be so entertaining?
themichaelowen,Thankfully after scoring 6 in training today the shirt stayed on! My stern words were obviously taken on board!
themichaelowen,His Dads celebration is boring so he can't of seen me do it! Trying to work out who he has copied.
themichaelowen,Watched my sons football training on Thursday. After he scored he took his shirt off to celebrate! He is only 5!
themichaelowen,Exciting to see Henry back in action over here. One of the best players ever to grace the Premier League.
themichaelowen,RT @TomDascombe: Just bought a Greyhound for the MHS staff to have a few nights out at Ellesmere Port! But what shall we call the dog?!  ...

themichaelowen,"By the way, Steven Taylor's gear?"
themichaelowen,"Hats off to Newcastle, they were outstanding. We will be back, starting Sunday."
themichaelowen,How much did Newcastle pay for Tiote? Bargain whatever he cost. #bigfanofhim
themichaelowen,@lavvo1 @terryowenjr you lot could be relying on @rpart1 this year to get your 5 a side crown back.
themichaelowen,That's a blow. Plenty of time to get back into it. Nothing pretty about the set up play but the finish was sublime.
themichaelowen,Newcastle started like a house on fire! We just need to weather the storm without conceding and take control once the game settles down!
themichaelowen,Come on lads!!!
themichaelowen,I reckon 0-0 or 1-1 in tonight's game. #gluedtothebox
themichaelowen,With me being injured I can appreciate why fans love the festive period. Games on virtually every day. #nowinterbreak! #footballingheaven
themichaelowen,@nath_pyeman Nice. There are are few goals in them beauties!!!
themichaelowen,@brucemillington Take your point and the fans like him but playing bad all year and chucks the towel in far too often for my liking.
themichaelowen,@rioferdy5 I take your point but my view would be all or nothing. Either accept mistakes will be made or ensure every big decision is right.
themichaelowen,Happy Birthday @Hayleyturner123
themichaelowen,"RT @ChesterRaces: Morning all! Its a dull morning at Chester Racecourse, but to brighten the mood - its only 19 weeks until May Festival ..."
themichaelowen,"@rioferdy5 Move with the times! Surely Rugby, Cricket etc are better for the introduction of technology?"
themichaelowen,Barton sending off looked harsh. More calls for video technology. I'd have to agree. No point only introducing it for ball crossing the line
themichaelowen,Darts Premier League line up announced later. Off the top of my head I'd go: Taylor Lewis Anderson Wade Painter Webster Nicholson Whitlock.
themichaelowen,"RT @silverfluffs: @themichaelowen 900,000 people sigh with disappointment!"

themichaelowen,@piersmorgan Ha Ha. You are good a wriggling out of tricky situations. You may need to be soon!
themichaelowen,@piersmorgan Who mentioned criminal activities? You got something to tell us?

themichaelowen,Wrap it up @GNev2 and @skysports_ed  You are good but the darts is about to start! Come on Lewis!
themichaelowen,I'm a fan of Alan Parry but why has he starting pronouncing Senderos' name in some weird accent?
themichaelowen,Arsenal still Premier League contenders @piersmorgan ?
themichaelowen,@aaowen @laurencebellman I did Lewis prior to the tournament at 9-1 so I'm not about to change now!
themichaelowen,Strange how Villa can beat Chelsea away then lose to Swansea at home. Similar to Blackburn. It's a funny old game!
themichaelowen,@aaowen @laurencebellman It said on tv that Southampton were dominating before the sending off. Wouldn't get too worried just yet!
themichaelowen,You can tell you have worked for a tabloid @piersmorgan. Chop out most of the sentence and tweak a few words to get the line that suits you!
themichaelowen,@piersmorgan I think old and saggy sums your breasts up perfectly. #moobs
themichaelowen,@OwenGemma Your Dad only needs 2 mins to get ready. Why do you need 20 mins?!!!
themichaelowen,So sad to hear the news that Gary Ablett has passed away today aged 46. He played for some great clubs and had a career to be proud of. RIP
themichaelowen,It has served us well but it's old and saggy now and ready to go! (cue the comparison jokes!!!) http://t.co/2yOgzkLd
themichaelowen,Mortified. Fell asleep watching the darts and missed what sounded like the best night of darts in history. My 9-1 Lewis bet is looking good!

themichaelowen,Happy New Year Everyone.
themichaelowen,"@piersmorgan Why, who didn't?"

themichaelowen,"Disappointing day. All credit to Blackburn, they played well. Getting some players back fit will help as our squad was a bit depleted today."
themichaelowen,Gutted there has to be a loser here. Unbelievable game. Darts is the best ever to watch!!!
themichaelowen,Never seen Part play this well. He has been on fire all tournament.
themichaelowen,Great match in prospect tonight. Two of my old teams. I reckon Liverpool will sneak it 1-0.
themichaelowen,What a game of darts this is on Sky Sports 1. I fancy Wade but Part has got plenty of bottle.

themichaelowen,My little bet on Adrian Lewis to win the tournament will be looking good if The Power gets knocked out here. Can't see it though!
themichaelowen,@rioferdy5 I agree. There are players who won very little but were 10 times the player or some with a cabinet full of medals.

themichaelowen,"@wyndomhols no, it starts with parents showing their kids how to behave."
themichaelowen,abuse at people?
themichaelowen,If somebody shouts abuse in the street like they do in a football stadium they would get locked up. Why does paying 30 entitle you to hurl
themichaelowen,@jeremygask their attitude is that they pay 30 so are entitled to abuse who they like. Baffling.
themichaelowen,@Dan_Macpherson Typical answer from a muppett fan. You really are clueless.
themichaelowen,decent as the so called fans abusing him. I would love Blackburn to get something out of the game to see his and the fans' reaction.
themichaelowen,"He may or may not be good enough but regardless, nobody deserves the abuse he is getting. He is probably a nice fella, no doubt twice as"
themichaelowen,I get the feeling the Blackburn fans want Bolton to win. This is the side of football I hate.

themichaelowen,Got a few special guests coming to Manor House Stables this afternoon. More on that later!
themichaelowen,Good game. Thought the ref was very good despite a few too many players trying to get the opposition booked.
themichaelowen,Few of you getting mixed up. I'm actually blaming the players. If they push and pull the opposition I think they don't deserve a warning.
themichaelowen,"On a brighter note, great win today which takes us top for a few hours at least!"
themichaelowen,whistle for a foul or a penalty once the ball is in play.
themichaelowen,"I've said it before but it's so frustrating. Please Refs, stop warning players and let play commence. You are more than welcome to blow your"

themichaelowen,There are only 1000 limited edition boxes available and @teletterpy are giving some away for free to their followers. #greatxmaspresent
themichaelowen,Played a brilliant new board game last night called Teletterpy where you have to guess the word that everyone else is thinking. @teletterpy
themichaelowen,I've been longing for this day for ages. Final day of X Factor. So pleased this rubbish will be off the box for Christmas.
themichaelowen,What a game that was. Sending off spoiled what was going to be a great last 15 mins and that wasn't the only strange decision.
themichaelowen,"If someone breaks the rules, award a penalty or free kick. I don't understand how this verbal warning at every corner has entered our game."
themichaelowen,Why do refs have to continually stop play at corners to warn people about pushing / pulling etc? It's wastes about 30 seconds every corner.
themichaelowen,@LukeDonald Some achievement that mate. Congrats.
themichaelowen,Looking forward to this game. I reckon there could be a few goals. Big admirer of both teams. Spurs look a real team this season.
themichaelowen,You have to feel for Blackburn. They are not getting much luck lately despite playing well in the main.
themichaelowen,"Judging by your comments, the fight wasn't that controversial and Khan deserved to lose. Still think the scoring system is outdated."
themichaelowen,I wouldn't fancy my career being so dependant on 3 old guys watching from below the ring. I'm sure the rich promoters have influence too!
themichaelowen,Gutted Amir Khan got beat last night. Controversy over the scoring I hear. Is there no better way to score a fight? Seems outdated to me.

themichaelowen,Strike a pose. Back to school! http://t.co/hZYCdu8s
themichaelowen,"Sad to hear Denman had to be retired today. A massive favourite with many Racing fans, it will be hard to forget 'The Tank'!"
themichaelowen,It looked a bad twist and it sounds like a serious injury. Bad news but I'm sure Vida will come back strong.
themichaelowen,Words can't describe the sorrow felt by everyone at Gary Speeds funeral today. His family were amazing. Our thoughts are with them.
themichaelowen,@piersmorgan I cringe for you. Some of your tweets are embarrassing.
themichaelowen,That hurt.
themichaelowen,The Gaffer agrees with me! Patience is the word - no panic.
themichaelowen,Tough first half an hour but patience is required now. Still confident.
themichaelowen,"Great result for Chelsea. Let's hope we do the same tomorrow. Very confident, plenty of big game players in the squad."
themichaelowen,"RT @bopollard: @themichaelowen Baby Bella is having an amazing recovery from CANCER surgery. Plz RT, help tell her story, http://t.co/33 ..."

themichaelowen,@tomclevz23 I played once and thrashed one of the top seeds. No names mentioned!
themichaelowen,The Euro Champs draw wouldn't be complete without a British Tabloid running a scare story about England's Hotel / Training pitch etc #boring
themichaelowen,@rioferdy5 @tomclevz23 Only 1 person unbeaten on pre season tour chaps!
themichaelowen,"How can defenders get away with that every time? Don't watch the ball, just stop the man. Refs have to clamp down."
themichaelowen,@lavvo1 Did the pitch look massive or does it just feel huge playing on it having to chase them for 90 mins?!!!
themichaelowen,@rioferdy5 It's a big decision in my house when you have 4 kids and a wife arguing! Just need to stick some chocolates on it now! Off today.
themichaelowen,Surprised most of you went for a Star. Going against public opinion! http://t.co/OKmpTFSt
themichaelowen,@MOLISAX I take your point!!!
themichaelowen,Big decision. Angel or Star to go on top of the Christmas Tree?
themichaelowen,Lesson learnt! Always knew West Ham were set up to be more effective away from home.
themichaelowen,West Ham and Portsmouth double is my fancy this week which pays around 2-1. Good luck.
themichaelowen,Going to have a look at the fixture list and horse racing shortly to pick out a best bet for the day. Hopefully keep my winning run going!
themichaelowen,Would love to be with the squad today but for my injury. I'm doing the next best thing though - buying our Christmas Tree! #excitedkids
themichaelowen,Settle for that draw!!!

themichaelowen,Gutted we got knocked out of the cup last night. I was eying up a starting place in the final like 2 years ago!
themichaelowen,Just been to Wrexham to do a Q&A with 250 school kids followed by autographs for them all. Off to do the school run now.
themichaelowen,Boooooom! Money safe in the satchel now I reckon!
themichaelowen,Looking good people! Don't tip many on here but when I do they collect!!!!

themichaelowen,@Joey7Barton Shell Suits not allowed on MOTD so I suspect you will never get asked!
themichaelowen,Thanks to Three Chimneys Farm for helping us sell our fillies today. Really pleased with the results.
themichaelowen,@devaracing Great result mate. Sad to see her go. The syndicate members must of loved every minute of owning her.
themichaelowen,@Joey7Barton So you would button in to the top fashion guru? Ever heard of Tom Ford or are you still wearing shell suits with Rockports?
themichaelowen,@Joey7Barton Don't talk about gear mate! Remember that I've seen your dress sense first hand. #horrific
themichaelowen,Take the shine off my forehead first! http://t.co/XySkcusj
themichaelowen,Backstage at the BBC. Going on air in half an hour. http://t.co/smjOUMdO
themichaelowen,I'd better watch the match as I'm on Match of the Day tonight talking about it. Still can't come to terms with earlier events. #RIPSpeedo
themichaelowen,He has died aged 42. So sad. He lived local to me and we knew his family. He leaves behind 2 sons. Tragic.
themichaelowen,Just cannot believe the news regarding Gary Speed. We waved at each other a couple of days ago dropping our kids off at school. I'm numb.
themichaelowen,"@LaurenceBellman TV work, Coaching Badges etc. All good experience. Just making sure I'm prepared for life after football!"
themichaelowen,@aaowen @mattykwilliams Don't bring me into this one! I'm enjoying this debate from afar. Alex winning it at present.
themichaelowen,@MattyKWilliams @_paulhayward I agree. They all come on here acting tough like that but 99% of fans shake my hand when they meet me.
themichaelowen,@_PaulHayward I agree that there is a grey area but I wouldn't say that challenge is a good example. Clearly not a penalty.
themichaelowen,I do feel for the officials. Too tough to get all decisions right which is why I would assist them for major decisions should they need it.
themichaelowen,It took more time for the ref and linesman to come to that decision than it would for somebody to watch a replay and they still got it wrong
themichaelowen,The less said about the penalty decision the better. Unbelievable. Video technology just for goals or major decisions too?
themichaelowen,Amazing game at OT today. Newcastle are a decent team. Couple of players to bolster their squad would make them stronger. Krul top class.
themichaelowen,@donaldmccain Overturn is the toughest horse in training! Well done mate.
themichaelowen,To all parents out there. Is it just me or are are boys a doodle to bring up compared to girls?
themichaelowen,Said I wouldn't but I'm back watching I'm a Celebrity! Willie Carson hilarious flicking them crickets. I would struggle with the Rats.

themichaelowen,"RT @bigmansmiffy: @piersmorgan @themichaelowen piers you have tweeted 6 x more than Michael, why haven't you got 6 x as many followers?"
themichaelowen,@piersmorgan And on that ridiculous note I will head off to bed. Churchill the nodding dog has more leadership qualities than you.
themichaelowen,@piersmorgan You are a great leader? What have you been drinking?
themichaelowen,@piersmorgan I've read your timeline! Are you sure you are popular?
themichaelowen,@piersmorgan If I tweeted 1000 times a day then I'm sure I would have similar numbers. You must have very little going on in your life.
themichaelowen,"@piersmorgan Oh I know, I lose sleep over how many followers I have. Well done for getting so many. You are my hero."
themichaelowen,Spurs looking very impressive in every area of the pitch. Harder than ever to predict the top 4 this year.
themichaelowen,@piersmorgan Bore off Lardy.
themichaelowen,Listen to Gary Neville people. He knows his onions and he gets his message across better than anybody on tv in my opinion.
themichaelowen,"@Ickey25 @lilickey22 Good luck, hope all goes well."

themichaelowen,@lesleypartridge Who couldn't do them tasks? Or at least try? Been watching for 10 mins and I'm on the verge of punching the tv already!
themichaelowen,@RichardThomas19 You are right. I hate these programmes. Went up to bed and the Mrs was watching it - not my choice!
themichaelowen,What's worse is the other contestants patting her on the back when she gets back to base. I would not be sympathetic at all I'm afraid.
themichaelowen,Why do these people go on I'm A Celebrity if they are scared of anything that moves? It's an absolute joke.
themichaelowen,Huge result for Liverpool and a winning goal fit to win any game.
themichaelowen,Good timing. Up a channel to watch the football then back down a channel later to watch the darts final!
themichaelowen,Taylor winds me up when he takes the board after every match! #darts
themichaelowen,"@LaurenceBellman I thought you would be back there straight away, only walking a Bull Terrier this time!"

themichaelowen,"@aaowen @laurencebellman Ha Ha! ""For a long for time"". What's that supposed to mean?"
themichaelowen,@terryowenjr Can't see it. Taylor was in top form last night. I'm just hoping for some Nicholson antics on the stage to wind Taylor up!!!
themichaelowen,"@aaowen @laurencebellman Fair enough, it certainly looks a good bet now. What about Donald or Hobbs? No chance?"
themichaelowen,@LaurenceBellman @aaowen Put your foot down Lol! Strictly and X Factor banned in my lounge. Them programmes only allowed in kitchen.
themichaelowen,@aaowen @laurencebellman Picking me up on my grammar? Make sure you don't make any accounting mistakes now as i will be watching!!!
themichaelowen,"@aaowen @laurencebellman Agreed! On another subject, how lucky are you with your bet?!!! Can't believe what I'm watching."
themichaelowen,Adrian Lewis is some arrow thrower. This next game should be entertaining!
themichaelowen,@aaowen @laurencebellman I wanted Overturn to win for Donald but I'm certain he wouldn't of. You are talking out of your pocket anyway!
themichaelowen,@aaowen @laurencebellman I do agree that he appeared more tired than Overturn but he was closing with every stride and had the momentum.
themichaelowen,@aaowen @laurencebellman So Overturn wasn't? They both were inevitably. I'm pretty sure Kauto was tired jumping the last too but still won.
themichaelowen,@aaowen @laurencebellman He was 3 lengths behind turning in and was upsides jumping the last. What race were you watching?
themichaelowen,This Swansea keeper impresses me every time I see him. What a save that was from Nani.
themichaelowen,@janegreen1 Happy Birthday! Your husband still punching above his weight I see!
themichaelowen,"@aaowen @laurencebellman Didn't have a bet on the race but I'm sure Oscar Whisky would have won. Love Overturn though, tough as nails."

themichaelowen,Hernandez is a goal machine.
themichaelowen,@aaowen they look unstoppable. I hope they do get promoted as I normally score against them!!!
themichaelowen,Just because I tipped West Ham to win doesn't mean I'm a secret West Ham fan! I just think their style is suited to playing away from home.
themichaelowen,@brucemillington I'm just glad I pointed it out before the race and not after. Some short memories out there. Privilege to watch that horse.
themichaelowen,Well done all those who followed me in on the double! Great day all round. Let's hope the boys do the business now!
themichaelowen,I'm forever blowing bubbles!!! #comeonyouhammers
themichaelowen,Kauto Star..... What a horse. Keep writing him off at your peril. The doubters will be right one day but not today. Retire him? #clueless
themichaelowen,Can't believe some of you got 5-1 about the double! Got just under 4-1 myself but still happy with that! #comeonyouhammers
themichaelowen,Strike 1 of my advised double! How was he allowed to go off at 2-1? What a horse. Come on you Hammers.
themichaelowen,Racing tip of the day is Master Minded. Not often you can back him at Odds Against. West Ham / Master Minded double for me!!!
themichaelowen,Great day of Sporting action. Football looks good. My main fancy would be West Ham to win at Coventry.
themichaelowen,Not backing Kauto Star today but I hope he runs a stormer. People are too quick to write him off. He is a legend and deserves more respect.
themichaelowen,Article on Page 8 of the Racing Post on Kauto Star is bang on. Take a bow Steve Dennis. It is a concurring theme in most sports.

themichaelowen,@piersmorgan No surprise you have food on your mind again. #9chins
themichaelowen,Just goes to show how important it is to be clinical in front of goal. Wigan should be ahead and Wolves go up the other end and score.
themichaelowen,Sunday Lunch with the family then home to watch the football in front of the fire! Huge game between Wolves and Wigan today.
themichaelowen,Good luck to the @WFAEnglandTeam in their final against USA today.
themichaelowen,On my way back from the match.. Good 3 points but the day will be remembered for the presentation to the Boss before the game. Unbelievable.
themichaelowen,Two days of Breeders Cup action about to start. Fingers crossed for a few European winners.
themichaelowen,"10 mins done, 1hr 20mins to go. Bored and cold, I hate being injured! http://t.co/Q54xQpBR"
themichaelowen,"@JPSPENCER1980 Good stuff, I will see you there. Are you riding at the Breeders Cup?"
themichaelowen,Thanks to everyone for your kind tweets. Gutted to miss out on playing yesterday. Had a scan earlier and just waiting on the results.
themichaelowen,I will pick a winner from website entries after the competition closes at midnight on Sunday.
themichaelowen,Click on Caption Competition link on my websites homepage to enter and be eligible for the prize.
themichaelowen,Caption Competition #5 is now live. Think of a caption for this Bonfire Night picture. Enter at http://t.co/Hc8Z5tfQ http://t.co/yprTZRGd
themichaelowen,Just hope it's not too serious and I'm back in action soon. Won't get too down. Lads got an important win to put us top of our group.
themichaelowen,Gutted about my injury. Felt my left quad as I reached out to try and score prior to Valencias goal. Was really looking forward to playing.
themichaelowen,RT @TomDascombe: @themichaelowen @MCYeeehaaa How about a RT for November's edition of Manor House Monthly. You made the front page Matt! ...
themichaelowen,@charlholland09 Happy Birthday Charlotte.
themichaelowen,@jamiecapper Happy Birthday mate.
themichaelowen,@billysharp10 Well done Billy. Puts football into perspective. I'm sure he will be very proud of his Dad.
themichaelowen,Do Lorries overtaking at 0.1mph faster than other Lorries taking 5 mins to get past annoy anybody else or is it just me?
themichaelowen,The 'Owen Clan' ready to hit the streets on the look out for sweets! http://t.co/2PWhx8o1
themichaelowen,The winner of Caption Competition #4 is Steve Partington ( @jambo_cb). His caption was 'Michael Owen seals it with another screamer!'
themichaelowen,"@MCYeeehaaa Great performance today mate, thanks a million."
themichaelowen,RT @lesleypartridge: Had a brilliant day at manor house stables today. Thank you @themichaelowen   xxx
themichaelowen,@rioferdy5 Best dressed at the club I reckon!!!
themichaelowen,Can see the arguments but IMO none are compelling enough and we should leave the clocks well alone!
themichaelowen,Surely farmers can get up an hour earlier if they want to work more? It's not like putting the clocks back gives us an hour more light?
themichaelowen,RT @MCYeeehaaa: On the way to Manor House Stables for a day with @themichaelowen and @TomDascombe. Yeeehaaa!
themichaelowen,Evenings lasting longer which is good for the economy is another popular shout. It seems most of the country are not sure why we have it.
themichaelowen,I'm even more confused! Most people saying its to prevent kids walking to or from school in the dark and lots saying its to do with farmers.
themichaelowen,What is the official reason behind it? It doesn't make the day last longer. Does the rest of the world follow suit? Can't see the point.
themichaelowen,The clocks going back an hour is of no benefit when you have kids yet it's a killer when they go forward. Abolish it I say!
themichaelowen,Hear it was at great game at Stamford Bridge. Not so great at Goodison Park but a massive result to get us back on track.
themichaelowen,Thanks to @umbro we will be offering another free pair of signed Umbro Speciali boots at some point next week.
themichaelowen,Here is Liliana who won the @umbro Specialis. Congratulations Liliana and thanks for sending the picture! http://t.co/EaQAoSWL
themichaelowen,"My 3rd child, Emily, is 4 tomorrow but we had the party today.  http://t.co/IPwJmWR9"
themichaelowen,Busy day today. Training this morning then back home for my daughters birthday party. In our Manchester hotel now preparing for tomorrow.
themichaelowen,@LukeDonald @Graeme_McDowell You golfers think alike! I can assure you it felt worse than that after the game!
themichaelowen,"Remember, only entries at www.michaelowen.com are eligible to win the prize. Feel free to tweet for fun!"
themichaelowen,Caption Competition #4 is now live and closes at midnight on Sunday. It's Halloween theme this week! http://t.co/omFysxpU
themichaelowen,I guess our Gaffer will be happy with Evertons game going to extra time with us playing them in an early kick off on Saturday!
themichaelowen,4 hours sleep and stinging eyes - don't you just love it when you hear the kids marching into your room ready to jump on you!
themichaelowen,Eagle has landed. Should be home for 2am. Good days work!
themichaelowen,@stevepalmer78 Has anyone tweeted you a question yet mate?! What you been drinking?
themichaelowen,Nice to be in the hat for the Quarter Finals. We are due a home draw!
themichaelowen,My two youngest had their jabs today at the Doctors so it could be an interrupted night!
themichaelowen,Nice to be winning again. Aldershot deserve a lot of credit for never giving up. About to board the plane back to Manchester.
themichaelowen,Looking forward to tonights game. I'm sure Aldershot will be right up for it so we will have to be mentally ready.
themichaelowen,Sat in the airport lounge waiting to fly down south. Due to arrive in time for lunch before resting in our hotel rooms this afternoon.
themichaelowen,"RT @SueProudley: @themichaelowen Utd losing like that was awful but you, your family & Steve made us so welcome we still had a brilliant ..."
themichaelowen,Surprised at the news regarding Sven being sacked by Leicester. Hadn't been aware of any speculation that he was under pressure.
themichaelowen,@henrywinter I have seen him a few times Henry and he impresses me every time. He is good enough for the Premier League in my opinion.
themichaelowen,Caption Competition #4 starts on Thursday. Details at www.michaelowen.com
themichaelowen,"Other good captions came from @P2hdg, @PhilADawson, @Beckham2010 and @princess_a_m_y."
themichaelowen,Thanks to everyone who entered. There were lots of Piers Morgan references but I thought Oli's was the best.
themichaelowen,"@OllieHoltMirror Your sources are on the ball! (good guess!) Seriously, we don't know yet."
themichaelowen,Congratulations to Oli Taylor @iamtaylorboy - the limited edition prize is on it's way to you!
themichaelowen,"The winning caption for Competition #3 is ""Michael tries the ""Piers Morgan Workout""."
themichaelowen,I'm going for a low scoring game tonight. Big Sam doesn't play too expansive away from home. A draw may be a decent result for both teams.
themichaelowen,RT @CorneliusRacing: #Southwell; Brown Panther's brother Third Half makes quite pleasing debut in 2nd behind Halling's Quest in mile-mai ...
themichaelowen,Caption Competition #3 closes at midnight tonight. Remember to head to my website to enter.
themichaelowen,More pictures from the day will be posted on my website www.michaelowen.com
themichaelowen,"As Sue has 3 children, I felt obliged to offer them 2 extra tickets! Sue travels to most United games making an 8 hour round trip each time."
themichaelowen,"I also presented the winner, Sue Proudley, with the shirt I wore against Leeds Utd in the last round of the Carling Cup."
themichaelowen,The Derby Day Competition Winners were at Old Trafford today to watch the game from my box with my family. http://t.co/Hxy0XxWE
themichaelowen,Nice hitting @Luke_Donald. You made more birdies in that final round than I have in my life!
themichaelowen,My normally beautiful dog even looks angry tonight!  http://t.co/wLRVi6DJ
themichaelowen,Another run like this is required! http://t.co/n4tj2IOv
themichaelowen,"3. Easy to accept defeat and limit the damage. That's not in our DNA. Playing in front of 75,000 fans at home. We have to attack to the end."
themichaelowen,"2. Even though Man City were very good, we would never of conceded 6 with 11 men."
themichaelowen,1. We haven't been in top form lately. If we had played them earlier on in the season (charity shield) it may of been a different result.
themichaelowen,"Just looking at my timeline. Understand the general feeling from the fans but even though the result was bad, there are reasons why."
themichaelowen,@piersmorgan I am a little annoyed tonight. Part of what has wound me up is the drivel you are forced to listen to after today's match.
themichaelowen,"@OllieHoltMirror players right. With all due respect, 99% of the country could of picked 9 out of our starting 11 today."
themichaelowen,@OllieHoltMirror haven't once. All I said is your 'inside info' is wrong. Now you are claiming it cant be that wrong as you got 9 out of 11
themichaelowen,@OllieHoltMirror It's the last I'm saying on the topic mate. You are telling everyone we have trained with a certain 11 all week but we
themichaelowen,"Fair play to Chelsea, considering they have 9 men then are making some first of getting back into this game."
themichaelowen,@piersmorgan You have a very short memory. I really can't be bothered tweeting to idiots tonight so if you don't mind.......
themichaelowen,@OllieHoltMirror that you are wrong and that your info is false. That's the point I am making.
themichaelowen,@OllieHoltMirror You named 11 players that you told your legion of followers we had been training with all week. I can categorically say
themichaelowen,@piersmorgan Let's refrain from talking football as you are clueless.
themichaelowen,@OllieHoltMirror not hard to guess 6 of our players. My 5 year old son could of told me Rooney was playing and I wasn't etc.
themichaelowen,Lot to be said about the timing of certain fixtures too. First 10 games of the season we were in top form. Lately we have not been ourselves
themichaelowen,Still wouldn't swap our squad for any other in the league. We will dust ourselves down and come back stronger.
themichaelowen,"Tough to take today where nothing went right. Hard enough playing top sides with 11 men. Credit to City, they played well."
themichaelowen,@OllieHoltMirror Don't know where you get your info from but we haven't trained like that all week at all.
themichaelowen,Or maybe I won't be on the bench as we have a big game on Tuesday that the Boss might want to keep me fresh for!!!
themichaelowen,Huge game today. Final preparations underway. Would be nice to sneak on the bench and make a similar impact to 2 years ago!
themichaelowen,@devaracing She has been a star this year mate. Tough as nails too. Wish we had a few more like her! Are Chester playing today? Any score?
themichaelowen,Not enough 3pm Prem games today. Where have Saturday 3pm kick offs gone? Soccer Saturday not the same with only 3 games on.
themichaelowen,"Once the squabbling over the whip ends we will look back on the season as one of the best in years. Frankel, Camelot, Brown Panther etc!!!!!"
themichaelowen,Camelot mega impressive in the Racing Post Trophy. Imagine owning a horse like that!

themichaelowen,@piersmorgan @joey7barton You were part of the whole culture so no wonder you condone some of the rubbish written in our press.
themichaelowen,@Joey7Barton other instead of this current rubbish? Do fans really want to read stuff that people haven't actually said?

themichaelowen,I've done it!!!! http://t.co/BqwMHs4o
themichaelowen,Meeting over. Looked at their strengths and weaknesses. Lunch in 15 mins then few hours to kill in our rooms before we head to the stadium.
themichaelowen,Wow. Just seen bits of Steve Rotherhams speech in Parliament yesterday. Sensational. Looking forward to seeing it in full when I get home.
themichaelowen,@DonaldsonJamie Who thrashed you at St Andrews playing some of the best golf you have ever seen?
themichaelowen,Been playing 4 suit Spider Solitaire all morning. Not won a single game. Fuming! Team meeting in half an hour followed by lunch.
themichaelowen,Congratulations Sue - I look forward to meeting you on Sunday!
themichaelowen,The good news is that as a result we have had a re-draw and the new winner is Sue Proudley from Reading
themichaelowen,The bad news is that the Canadian winner of the Derby Day competition is unable to be at the game due to travel problems.
themichaelowen,Not much access to the news out here in Romania but good to hear some positive statements being made at the Hillsborough debate today.
themichaelowen,"His winning caption was ""you won't be smiling when you see what I've done on the carpet""."
themichaelowen,Congratulations to @simonriddiford who I chose as the winner of the Caption Competition #2.
themichaelowen,Landed in Romania. Expected it to be warmer - it's freezing! Couple of hours in our hotel rooms then we head to the stadium for training.
themichaelowen,Can't pick a winner here. Spurs got some great players but Newcastle playing great all season. I think Modric is top top drawer.
themichaelowen,If you think that was a pen then you accept that falling over when touched even though you can stay on your feet is acceptable.
themichaelowen,"On the other hand, if you go down when you can easily stand up even though you have been touched is that not wrong? Not sure myself."
themichaelowen,Part of the art of striking is to tempt a defender in to foul you. If he dives in like that then he runs the risk giving away a penalty.
themichaelowen,"Your right people, I've done it too. Twice against Argentina for starters. Could of stood up but was touched and won a penalty both times."
themichaelowen,Was that a pen people? My view is yes but a good example of player going down when touched even though he could easily stay on his feet.
themichaelowen,Caption Competition #2 closes at midnight tonight. Winner announced tomorrow.
themichaelowen,@Levi_Murphy I was in the 20 man squad. Me and Fabio didn't make bench though. Not easy when Rooney and Hernandez on the bench! #toughschool
themichaelowen,Glad some of you get my humour! It's called 'being able to laugh at yourself'. It's not a bad trait to have people.
themichaelowen,@WayneRooney And Me!!!!!
themichaelowen,Frankel = Wow!
themichaelowen,Good game today. Not many teams will win at Anfield this season.
themichaelowen,Getting on the coach heading for Anfield in 10 mins. The lads are buzzing for this one.
themichaelowen,Surprised they don't use video technology in Rugby for sendings off as they use it for other big decisions.
themichaelowen,Don't agree with it and it should be clamped out in all sports but when the stakes are high players will gain any advantage available.
themichaelowen,That's why players stay down and act hurt / protest to ref. Likely that moment is the difference between winning and losing. #streetwise
themichaelowen,Classic example of why players surround a ref. If the French players never made a meal out of the tackle then Wales would still have 15 men.
themichaelowen,Come on Wales.
themichaelowen,Early night as we are up at the crack of dawn to prepare for tomorrows early kick off.
themichaelowen,Once the winner has been chosen and everything has been verified it will be announced on my website at some point over the weekend.

themichaelowen,Off to bed. Been a busy day of tweeting today! Premier League is back this weekend. Can't wait.
themichaelowen,Great draw for Ireland today. Would be great if they made the finals. They look certainties to qualify with the 2nd leg being at home.
themichaelowen,@crinkle06 @syby45 So another McCririck type figure who gets paid to talk rubbish about something he hasn't got a clue about?
themichaelowen,@syby45 Who is Adrian Durham?
themichaelowen,@chris_kammy getting hit or hurt. People need to listen to people in the know and stop bowing to outside pressure.

themichaelowen,@chris_kammy You are right Kammy. I would invite you and the Sky cameras to my yard to see them training and then to my home to see my
themichaelowen,@MattyKWilliams Doubt it mate. United v Liverpool in two days so I doubt we will be agreeing about much else!
themichaelowen,"@PaddyBrennan22 Don't know why I'm getting so worked up! Been a bad day for sport today. Negative headlines for Football, Rugby and Racing."
themichaelowen,@MattyKWilliams I agree. It's TV and Radios fault for employing such idiots. Cheap way for them to get a headline. Irresponsible.
themichaelowen,Why do @SkySportsNews give air time to people with no idea? Ask the professionals. John McCririck does more damage to the sport than good.
themichaelowen,@MattyKWilliams most people would prefer that mate but you know that's unrealistic. Too big a story to keep a lid on.
themichaelowen,@MattyKWilliams Bit late for that now mate. Damage has been done and now all eyes are on them to see how they get Racing out of this mess.
themichaelowen,@MattyKWilliams If nobody made a deal of it do you think the rules would be changed? No chance. It takes debate to promote change.
themichaelowen,@MattyKWilliams these issues on themselves. The jockeys haven't. And who timed the intro of this new rule? Nobody to blame for that either?
themichaelowen,@MattyKWilliams Well don't bring in a new rule in the first place if it's not been thought through or trialled properly. They have brought
themichaelowen,@MattyKWilliams Doesn't matter who you are or what you earn. If there is an injustice then you are within your rights to express your views.
themichaelowen,@MattyKWilliams Ridiculous comment mate. He is one of the most skilled horsemen in the land. What has a nurse got to do with it?
themichaelowen,@MattyKWilliams @brucemillington What has he done that is out of order?
themichaelowen,@brucemillington Still hold the same views on the whip debate? Surely the professionals have to be listened to?
themichaelowen,Desperate news hearing that @Jack_Marshall_ has passed away. Thoughts go out to his family.
themichaelowen,Disappointing news regarding @WayneRooney. Missing 3 games on such a big stage seems a bit harsh.
themichaelowen,"@PaulHayward_gnm You can have anything but him! My house, my car, my wife but not Brown Panther! (careful how you reply as you know my mrs!)"
themichaelowen,I've been glued to the toilet seat! #gonestraightthroughme #toomuchinformation
themichaelowen,This is ridiculous. Cherry juice was the 'in thing' to take last year. Now it's Beetroot juice. Since drinking a bottle of it earlier today
themichaelowen,@aaowen Sounds great! I'm coming to join you!
themichaelowen,@aaowen mates. There needs to be a massive bond between players in team sports and maybe that is one way of forming a tighter unity.
themichaelowen,"@aaowen Put it this way, nobody playing at that elite level are alcoholics so it's not a sacrifice. It's just a way of socialising with"
themichaelowen,"@aaowen Anyway, have you nothing better to do in the office than to abuse me! Plenty of horses to sell!!!"
themichaelowen,"@aaowen mates can help ease the tension, help team spirit etc. As I said, Wales have done it so it can't compromise performance that much!"
themichaelowen,@aaowen it feels like to be under that much pressure being away from your family living out of a suitcase etc. Sometimes a drink with your
themichaelowen,@aaowen drinks. I'm not condoning getting drunk but I am saying it's easy for you to sit there and point the finger not having a clue what
themichaelowen,@aaowen Did you not see your countries head coach on tv earlier? He said that the Wales squad have had a few nights where they had a few
themichaelowen,"@PaulHayward_gnm By the way, fancy writing my book in a few years so we can get all these opinions off my chest!"
themichaelowen,@PaulHayward_gnm creating news stories out of nothing. No other country does it.
themichaelowen,@PaulHayward_gnm not bad going. I just wish people would concentrate on the sport and not hinder our chances at every major tournament by
themichaelowen,@PaulHayward_gnm big tournaments. To be away for that long and to be criticised for having a drink of lager and jumping in a harbour is
themichaelowen,"@PaulHayward_gnm Ok! We agree! On the pitch you are dead right but even though they were no angels off it, I know what it's like to play in"
themichaelowen,"@PaulHayward_gnm well. Oh, and Rugby players are not the example to follow any more. There is so much rubbish spoken it's frightening."
themichaelowen,@PaulHayward_gnm for everything they did and just because we didn't win it again it's for every other reason except that we didn't play very
themichaelowen,@PaulHayward_gnm referees etc. What gets me is that our rugby players win the world cup a few years back and they get lauded (rightly so)
themichaelowen,@PaulHayward_gnm Indiscipline? Surely not from a rugby player? Us footballers get told to follow the lead of rugby players. Respectful to
themichaelowen,@PaulHayward_gnm Don't think anybody disagrees that from a playing side it was disappointing but why all these 'off field antics' excuses?
themichaelowen,"@PaulHayward_gnm Obviously jumping off a boat wasn't the brightest thing to do but again, he didn't kill anyone. Massive overreaction IMO."
themichaelowen,@PaulHayward_gnm Explain the betrayal bit Paul. I didn't see 30 rugby players beating someone up outside a bar. Merely having a few drinks.
themichaelowen,Caption Competition closes at midnight on Sunday 16th Oct and winner announced the following morning. My tin hat is on!!!
themichaelowen,I read every entry and once I pick a winner I check to ensure the caption isn't identical to any others so no bad losers this week please!
themichaelowen,"Problem solved! By the way, you can abuse me (as normal!) but not my dog!"
themichaelowen,Caption Competition 2 http://t.co/wIaZ0MQb
themichaelowen,The caption competition pic is now on my website. Having trouble posting it from my phone. Will keep trying!
themichaelowen,I watched England U16's on Sky last night. Some decent prospects on show. Let's hope a few of them make the grade.
themichaelowen,Caption Competition at 8am today. Remember you can only enter at www.michaelowen.com
themichaelowen,Wales coach just came on tv saying they have had a few drinks while away. Is that good management by him as they are in the semis? #fickle
themichaelowen,I bet every other team has done worse only any little thing gets reported in our country. Can't we just accept that we just played poorly?
themichaelowen,Tv and Newspaper headlines again full of rubbish about England's off field antics at Rugby World Cup. Still fail to see what they did wrong.
themichaelowen,I've finally picked a picture to use for the Caption Competition tomorrow. Opened myself up to a bit of abuse I reckon!
themichaelowen,Anybody see that deer like animal butting the cyclist off his bike on @SkySportsNews? Unbelievable!
themichaelowen,@stevepalmer78 Say that to his face!!!
themichaelowen,@thesupporteruk Congrats mate!
themichaelowen,Perks of the job! Kids size 10 for my little fella. Thanks @umbro. http://t.co/kZ27CkLZ
themichaelowen,"As it happens, it all looked normal today and I've no strong opinion on the new rules. It's the politics of the decision that concerns me."
themichaelowen,@Hayleyturner123 Totally agree. It's like football scrapping the offside rule because half the population doesn't understand it.
themichaelowen,"RT @Hayleyturner123: The whip rule was changed for public perception, maybe it's the public perception that needs changing?"
themichaelowen,I'm on Question of Sport tonight at 10:35pm on BBC1!
themichaelowen,Caption Competition #2 starts on Thursday.
themichaelowen,"Thanks to everyone who entered. There were loads of funny suggestions, many unprintable!"
themichaelowen,"The winning Caption was: ""Owen caught between the sheets with his biggest fan!""."
themichaelowen,Congratulations to Steve Johnston @thesupporteruk who is the winner of the Caption Competition #1.
themichaelowen,Never seen Taylor play so bad. Poor standard.
themichaelowen,Hope Dolan wins though. Scenes would be unbelievable in his homeland!
themichaelowen,Great achievement by Dolan getting to the final but surely this is one of the most one sided darts finals in a long time?
themichaelowen,Next caption competition starts on Thursday. Already thinking of potential photos to post that would stimulate some funny captions!
themichaelowen,Just a reminder. Caption competition on my website closes at midnight tonight. Winner is announced in the morning. www.michaelowen.com
themichaelowen,My kids just had a race in the back garden. My 3 year old daughter beat my 5 year old son. She is rapid! Sprint training needed for him!
themichaelowen,@EdwardSnowden The Ormonde at Chester in May is a possible starting point.
themichaelowen,@eaoweneaowen Happy Birthday.

This is where I have been this afternoon!"
themichaelowen,@T_BLY82 They are all local to me! I ventured into Chester today instead. Best City in the world. Just got back to bath the kids before bed.
themichaelowen,@piersmorgan No point going to the gym 4 times a week if you visit the fridge 15 times a day. #largeundies
themichaelowen,@piersmorgan for much longer?
themichaelowen,Grandparents are great! My Mother in Law just offered to look after the kids for the afternoon so I'm off down the pub with the lads.
themichaelowen,"@piersmorgan Assuming that is the case, did you get your #moobs, 4 chins and belly from drinking too much, eating too much or both?"
themichaelowen,"@piersmorgan By virtue of you dodging yet another question, can we assume you do no exercise?"
themichaelowen,"@piersmorgan Your right! Out of interest, what form of exercise do you do?"
themichaelowen,@stevepalmer78 I like Bronterre 3:10 personally but that's not a tip! Few shocks in the darts so far. Can you see past Taylor?
themichaelowen,Now the rugby is over it has the makings of an average Saturday. No Prem football is the killer. Looks like Racing and Darts for me.
themichaelowen,Some belting answers so far in my Caption Competition! Racking my brain already as to what photo to post for next weeks competition!
themichaelowen,"@Graeme_McDowell I like it! At least it's a clean caption, unlike some I've read so far!"

themichaelowen,the game. Over and out my friends!
themichaelowen,generalise. I may be wrong but I do think footballers can be easy targets so just wanted to stick up for the majority of good guys that play
themichaelowen,players give generously to loads of different charities etc. There are plenty of decent people that play football. Far too easy to just
themichaelowen,etc. Of course they are superstars and I think everyone agrees they should earn more but how can you blame footballers for that? Most
themichaelowen,"the abuse. Footballers are entertainers, they draw in huge crowds just like those mentioned. Very unfair to then compare our wages to nurses"
themichaelowen,"deserve their share? Nobody seems to mention singers, actors, golfers, F1 drivers etc that earn far more than footballers yet we take all"
themichaelowen,Not denying footballers get paid a lot of money. They do however earn their employers huge amounts. If that's the case then surely they
themichaelowen,Can't get to sleep! Don't want to open a can of worms but just want to justify one of my previous answers regarding footballers wages.

themichaelowen,Family day. Trip to the zoo. http://t.co/dc6Mi3Oi
themichaelowen,@stevepalmer78 The Arc looks a great race this year. Despite an average draw I'm siding with Sarafina. Hope a British horse wins though.
themichaelowen,We had planned a BBQ today with the good weather all week. All food and drink bought yesterday. Open the curtains before and it's raining.
themichaelowen,medicine contains a banned substance. Makes my so jealous when I see my Mrs taking night nurse etc before bed. I'm stuck with strepsils!
themichaelowen,Downside of being a footballer is you have to let every illness take it's course without any assistance from medicine etc. Virtually every
themichaelowen,I would like to blame 1 of my kids for my illness but I got it from the club. One of the lads brought it in. Half of the team have it now.
themichaelowen,"@stevepalmer78 Had you been out on the lash? Don't spoil it for me, want to read about it in your Sunday column next week!"
themichaelowen,"Not enjoying this. 3:40am and not getting an ounce of sleep. Bunged up, sore throat and cough. I hate being ill."
themichaelowen,"@Joey7Barton Brown Panther is tucked away in his stable and out at grass for a few hours a day. Had some tough races, deserves his break."
themichaelowen,@Joey7Barton You end up wanting to put the world to rights on here but 140 digits is never enough! Well done today with your filly.
themichaelowen,a replay 20 yards from you whereby the correct decision is always awarded within seconds. The correct decision doesn't always occur in footy
themichaelowen,I agree with your calls for footballers respecting referees like rugby players. All I would say is it's easier to show respect when it's on
themichaelowen,Footballs answer so far has been to add 2 more officials behind the goals! Still waiting to see one of them make a decision.
themichaelowen,"remarks about the officials. It can't be healthy for the sport. As I say, Rugby seems to have the answer and that is to assist the officials"
themichaelowen,is talking about referee decisions. Managers have a responsibility but so do the people asking the questions. They bait managers into making
themichaelowen,"There will still be the odd error but they get all the big decisions right. Again, after today's games you switch the radio on and everybody"
themichaelowen,"Watched loads of rugby lately, both Union and League. I'm an expert all of a sudden! Their refereeing system has to transfer to football."
themichaelowen,Norwich played well today. Denied us space in the dangerous areas. They stand a good chance of staying up on that evidence.
themichaelowen,"A clean sheet and 3 points were the positives from today. We were not our usual selves but as ever, the result is the most important thing."
themichaelowen,"I think City will beat Blackburn. Also think Spurs will beat Arsenal. Merseyside Derby too close to call. And of course, a United win!"
themichaelowen,Rugby over. Now on to football and racing! I love Saturday's. Who does everyone fancy in today's Premier League?
themichaelowen,Imagine being at the bottom of one of them rugby pile ups. Bad enough if you score and a couple of footballers jump on top of you! #squashed
themichaelowen,"RT @PaulHayward_gnm: @themichaelowen I bet jockeys wish they could switch horses in mid-race. Mind you, I think Lester Piggott sometimes ..."
themichaelowen,My ears can't bare it!!! Did anyone doubt the man? (apart from the commentator who is now waxing lyrical)
themichaelowen,Ready for it!!!
themichaelowen,Rugby commentator saying Wilkinson should be replaced before. Scores a drop goal now he is telling us 'that's the measure of the man'.
themichaelowen,Early rise for me. Sore throat and snotty nose caused an interrupted sleep. Feels like years since we had a 3pm kick off. Need a win today.
themichaelowen,That's me finished for today. Don't want to be clogging people's timelines up too much! Be back on tomorrow. See you everyone.

themichaelowen,Leaving the stadium now. I've not played for a while and then 2 games in the space of a few days. Been a test but my body feels great.
themichaelowen,Tough game today. Not many teams will win at The Britannia this season. Crouch played well as did most of their team. Draw probably fair.
themichaelowen,"RT @PaulHayward_gnm: In tomorrow's Observer: exclusive interview with @themichaelowen. Read him on Chicharito, England, the art of scori ..."
themichaelowen,Ha Ha! Lesson to myself - gloat once the final whistle blows! What a game.
themichaelowen,Not over yet but a few of you were quick to hammer me for my Brighton prediction!!! Goal scorers worth their weight in gold. #Mackail-Smith

The general view is his quotes have been sensationalised"
themichaelowen,@PaulToomey1 Don't get told the team until 2 hours before kick off. I suspect it will take more than 2 goals to get into our team!!!
themichaelowen,@Stevo1969 Not sure. Close game. Giggsy knows his Rugby. Just asked him and he thinks Leeds will shade it.
themichaelowen,@thesupporteruk Stay in a hotel the night before for all games except night kick offs where we stay in a hotel from lunch time onwards.
themichaelowen,"Just on the team coach heading to our hotel. Dinner, watch tv, bed. Can't wait for tomorrow. Always a great atmosphere at The Britannia."
themichaelowen,What's the verdict on tonight's game? I'm going for a Brighton victory. They looked decent against Liverpool on Wednesday.
themichaelowen,Finished training. The lads are well prepared for the threats Stoke will pose. Normally one of the toughest games of the season.
themichaelowen,"players running down the clock when their team are protecting a result. Finally, it relieves the ref of a job he doesn't need to do."
themichaelowen,"Rugby. As soon as there is a break in play the clock stops. Far too much time wasted waiting for corners, free kicks etc. Also will deter"
themichaelowen,Totally agree with @brucemillington article on page 94 of today's @racing_post. I think a clock needs to be employed like in basketball and

themichaelowen,Mrs out with my eldest at horse riding trials. I've got the 3 youngsters. Pepper Pig on DVD is doing the trick.
themichaelowen,So sad to hear Ginger McCain has passed away. Thoughts are with Donald and the McCain family from your friends 'next door' at Manor House.
themichaelowen,Now we turn our attention to Leeds on Tuesday. Wont be no ordinary Carling Cup clash. Huge rivalry. Can't wait.
themichaelowen,What a game. Had a bit of everything. That goal from Nani was sensational. He is some talent. Fast becoming one of the best players around.
themichaelowen,My Dads side of the family are Scottish and all big Celtic fans. Been brought up supporting them as my 'Scottish Team'.
themichaelowen,Wow! I think ghat deserved a yellow card! #oldfirm
themichaelowen,Watching the golf before we leave for the game. Fair play to @IanJamesPoulter he has some bottle. At Matchplay there ain't many better.
themichaelowen,@aj_marsden7 Another with my name and number on their back! Thanks for your support.
themichaelowen,@TeejKennerley Top man - thanks mate!
themichaelowen,A good win for our Rugby lads this morning. Decent performance but the result is all that matters in tournament play.
themichaelowen,Match Day. Lads all in confident mood and looking forward to the challenge. Pre match meal at 1pm and then we leave our hotel to head for OT
themichaelowen,Tough to predict them Premiership results today. Some big wins for teams near the bottom although it's still early days.
themichaelowen,Are pheasants the dopiest birds in the world? Every time I leave the house they try to get stuck under my wheels! http://t.co/LzWEDAPO
themichaelowen,RT @WorneDogg: @themichaelowen do you like our cool runnings fancy dress?? Worth a RT surely!?  http://t.co/Feg6o6dX
themichaelowen,@TraceJ67 Cheshire Oaks tonight but Chester would be slightly closer to my house.
themichaelowen,@JeffOrf Good on you mate - cheers.
themichaelowen,@iwank_Ridwan Of course. I am fit and ready but I would think I have more chance of playing against Leeds on Tuesday.
themichaelowen,The only films I've watched are films I've been forced to watch! Like when we go as a team etc and there is no getting out of it!
themichaelowen,Thanks for all your recommendations but I've tried most of them. 10 mins viewing and it gets switched off.
themichaelowen,"Other films I've watched: Jurassic Park, Ghost, Heat, Cool Running. Think that's it!"
themichaelowen,What horrific news about the miners in Wales. Thoughts are with the families who have lost loved ones.
themichaelowen,Unfortunately no kissing on the back row either!!! My mouth was full of popcorn at all times so no chance of that!
themichaelowen,Film was good. Popcorn wasn't bad either! Known my wife since I was born. Been together for last 14 years. 1st ever trip to cinema together!
themichaelowen,@sonofkrypton78 Long story! Attention span is one thing but the other reason takes too long to explain!
themichaelowen,"@kevjmanley: @themichaelowen which is your fav rocky film ?
Rocky 3 or 4, can't decide."
themichaelowen,Can't stand films but watched the Inbetweeners series so got to give it a go. Watched about 8 films in my life and 5 of them were Rocky!!!
themichaelowen,Going to the cinema tonight for the first time in years! Watching The Inbetweeners. Can't wait to munch some popcorn!!!
themichaelowen,Why the fuss? Have our rugby players done that much wrong? Hard enough to win a World Cup without people making something out of nothing.
themichaelowen,@MattyKWilliams It's only a couple of metres wide mate so I wouldn't bother!
themichaelowen,@Sacollier09: @themichaelowen has it got any slides? &gt; Ha Ha - like it!

themichaelowen,Got home at 3:25am. Up at 6:45am. About to set off to do the school run before heading into training to prepare for Chelsea on Sunday.
themichaelowen,Normal match day routine for the lads today - eat and rest. Going for a walk to stretch our legs before lunch.
themichaelowen,Tonights stadium reminds me of The Emirates. Arsenals pitch is better though. If they wet it the game will be fast. Hard pitch and fast ball
themichaelowen,Just landed in Portugal. Heading to our hotel. Training at the stadium tonight. The Champions League is back!
themichaelowen,Early start. Packing my bag ready for our trip to Portugal. I will organise myself and pack the night before one day!
themichaelowen,@Julesw24 That's him. I remember him. He was one of the nicer lads at Lilleshall! All the best.
themichaelowen,"@bapj33: @themichaelowen agreed, however they do have an added responsibility because of the audience they hold. Don't you think?
Agree"
themichaelowen,Even though there have been no goals this has been an entertaining game. QPR look impressive. Surprised if it finishes 0-0.
themichaelowen,@OllieHoltMirror My parents were and still are my role models. I had favourite footballers but my Dad was the person I wanted to be like.
themichaelowen,@OllieHoltMirror They should be aware of their responsibilities but parents should primarily be responsible for their kids behaviour.
themichaelowen,@OllieHoltMirror I agree. Just because someone is good at kicking a ball around doesn't mean separate rules should be thrust upon them.
themichaelowen,@Joey7Barton captaining QPR tonight. Looking forward to the game. There will be a great atmosphere with their new signings on parade.
themichaelowen,"I've mentioned it before but love him or hate him, Gary Neville knows his onions and provides a great insight into the game for the viewers."
themichaelowen,@Dowdsy12 @waynerooney I'm sure he will pass my total but I'm hoping to add to it myself in the next couple of years!
themichaelowen,@littlerevz Thanks for them!!!
themichaelowen,@Julesw24 Is your husband Luke? Pretty sure that was his name. I think he played on the left wing.
themichaelowen,@RAC_Care You were very good thanks! Would of been even better if you brought a spare tyre with you!
themichaelowen,Good to hear the news coming out that Tom Cleverley hasn't broken his foot. Lets hope he makes a speedy recovery.
themichaelowen,Never in doubt! Made it in with 15 mins to spare. No fines and no hairdryer!
themichaelowen,Never felt so guilty! Left my Dad stood on the side of M56 waiting for help while I take his car - and it's his Birthday! #bestmates
themichaelowen,Dads birthday and he is sitting with my car until RAC arrive. Feel guilty but I can't be late for work!
themichaelowen,Sat on hard shoulder. Just had a blow out while driving down the motorway. RAC on way as is my Dad whose car I'm taking! http://t.co/bLY5nGK
themichaelowen,About to set off for training. It's great to be at training after a win. The place is buzzing. Then it's home for a Sunday Roast Dinner.
themichaelowen,My best mate celebrates his birthday today. Happy Birthday Dad.
themichaelowen,Most saying Rooney and Aguero. Have to agree. Suarez looks good. Woodgate / Shawcross flying at Stoke. I knew Woody would be a great signing
themichaelowen,@StevenEllis92 That's why I didn't like Hulk Hogan. He scared me when I was a kid beating up Rocky when he was called Thunderlips!!!
themichaelowen,"@terryowenjr: @themichaelowen @Joey7Barton what about bam bam bigalo http://t.co/mJN3hqw
Great shout Brother. Legend!"
themichaelowen,"Enough of wrestling. Let's talk football. Four games in, who has been the Star Man in the Premier League so far?"
themichaelowen,"@PokerPimp05: @themichaelowen who was better, typhoon or tugboat?
&gt;Tugboat. I loved him before he joined Earthquake to form a tag team."
themichaelowen,"Disliked: Hulk Hogan, Macho Man, Deano Bravo, Sgt Slaughter, Andre The Giant, Bad News Brown, Rick Flair, Roddie Piper, Superfly, Haku."
themichaelowen,"Liked: U.Warrior, Mr Perfect, The Rockers, Bushwackers, Legion of Doom, The Mountie, Undertaker, The Model, Earthquake, Typhoon, Demolition."
themichaelowen,"Loads of you loving Brett 'Hitman' Hart. Liked him too, especially in his tag team with Jim 'The Anvil'. Hated the Million Dollar Man."
themichaelowen,@Joey7Barton @hayleymcqueen Paul Bearer wasn't it?
themichaelowen,"@Joey7Barton He annoyed me a bit. The Undertaker was a legend. His finishing move, The Tombstone was brilliant."
themichaelowen,Tennis back on. Surely this game can't match the last one for excitement. That was some point though!
themichaelowen,"@Joey7Barton Remember Earthquakes finishing move? Big sweaty backside sat in his opponents face. His tag team partner, Typhoon, was good too"
themichaelowen,@Joey7Barton what a shout Papa Shango is! Loved The Bushwackers too. Brutus The Barber Beefcake was good as was Earthquake.
themichaelowen,@Joey7Barton Used to love WWF 20 years ago but can't stand it now. Who was the best? I loved The Ultimate Warrior and Mr Perfect.
themichaelowen,@terryowenjr When there is that much of a class gap it's impossible. The challenger could have 4 arms and still not hit him.
themichaelowen,This is torture. He is going to get hurt here. Huge mismatch. Corner should pull him out and look after their man.
themichaelowen,@MattyKWilliams Can't believe @brucemillington is the outsider in that match up.
themichaelowen,@Joey7Barton Go collect. This ain't lasting long. Feel sorry for this fella. Out of his league.
themichaelowen,@MattyKWilliams Don't talk about eyes pal. You have a right dodgy pair of mincers yourself. Who wins this next Semi?
themichaelowen,@Joey7Barton Man against Boy this mate. This won't last long. The challenger looks like a middleweight next to Klitschko.
themichaelowen,@MattyKWilliams Maybe pure class at tennis but Federer is pure class full stop.
themichaelowen,Torn now. Tennis is great tv but Boxing on 403. Tough to turn down watching a World Heavyweight Championship bout. Boxing it is I'm afraid.
themichaelowen,Tennis on 401. Not a huge fan but hope Federer wins this game. The fella is pure class.
themichaelowen,@C_Stephens5 He was on the microphone after the game arguing with people in the home section of the crowd. Looked to be getting heated.
themichaelowen,How mad was that incident with the Bournemouth Chairman today? Just seen it on Sky.
themichaelowen,@chris_kammy Jonny Mudball.
themichaelowen,@DStardust Hard to call. Spurs' was a big win as Wolves is a difficult place to go. Our win was a big result. Big win for Stoke too.
themichaelowen,@chris_kammy Different gear Kammy!
themichaelowen,Result of the day in the Premier League today people?
themichaelowen,@devaracing @brucemillington it's an option mate. Exciting discussions to be had. They say that today's race broke the course record too.
themichaelowen,"Also massive thanks to all at Manor House Stables, @TomDascombe and @RKingscote for their contributions in making today possible."
themichaelowen,Thanks to all at Mickley Stud. I hope Treble Heights (Brown Panthers Mum) is proud of her boy today.
themichaelowen,Brown Panthers brother relaxing with his mates. He's a yearling (1 year old) and he starts training next year. #cantwait http://t.co/7YZCJuG
themichaelowen,What about @WayneRooney scoring another hat trick? Back to back Prem hat tricks ever been done before?
themichaelowen,@Joey7Barton Thanks mate. It was unbelievable. Easy to get carried away but K.Fallon loved him. Could be some huge races in the future!
themichaelowen,"@brucemillington: @themichaelowen He ran a blinder. Where next?
Drop to the big 1m4f races next year or step him up to Cup distances."
themichaelowen,Any kids out there - watch the movement for Hernandez's first goal. That's how to lose a defender in the box. #class
themichaelowen,Brown Panther wouldn't let himself down on the firm ground according to K.Fallon. He is a serious horse especially with juice in the ground.
themichaelowen,What a day. What a daaaaaaaay! So happy. I've got a superstar of a horse and the boys put in another huge performance in a 5-0 win.
themichaelowen,Arrived at the Reebok in plenty of time! http://t.co/57OXOHJ
themichaelowen,"@JudeBrent: @themichaelowen Will we see you make an off the bench appearance in this weeks game?
Hope so. Came on and scored here last year"
themichaelowen,"@Michaelevo: @themichaelowen are you fully fit now Michael?
&gt;Yes, I'm fully fit. Just tough to force your way into this team!!!"
themichaelowen,"@pablo_michaels I think Blue Bunting is the one to beat. Saying that, Brown Panther is in great shape and ready to run the race of his life."
themichaelowen,"@brucemillington Yes, going to Donny and then heading straight to The Reebok Stadium after the race to join the squad. Day of a lifetime!!"
themichaelowen,@skysports_ed Thanks Ed. What a day of sport. I love Saturdays!
themichaelowen,"@DjDane73: @themichaelowen Can you wish my better other half @JoFaulkner75 a happy birthday for today please :)
Happy Birthday!"

themichaelowen,@Joey7Barton Like it too. Gone are the days of full backs just defending. Need to be attacking players with C.Midfld players more defensive.
themichaelowen,Surprised to see Lampard not playing. Jones was tipped to start too and didn't even make the bench. Looks a decent enough team though.
themichaelowen,"@OllieHoltMirror The joys of international football! Good luck to the boys, big game - we need a win."
themichaelowen,@OllieHoltMirror I thought he was one of the best players to play at Old Trafford last year when he played for Villa.
themichaelowen,@OllieHoltMirror I've always thought the opposite. I think he is one of the most underrated players in the Premiership.
themichaelowen,"@scarylary: @themichaelowen here's the big question... Did you wash that kit before framing?? &gt; yes, but not the match ball or boots!"
themichaelowen,@jamesmcclure27 Brown Panther is fine thanks. He runs in The St Leger a week on Saturday.
themichaelowen,"@1kempie Yes, still got that shirt. I keep all the important ones I've worn throughout my career. Got about 20 framed in my Snooker room."
themichaelowen,10 yearlings bought at Doncaster this week. Now we just need to find owners for them! Manorhousestables.com is the place to view them all.

themichaelowen,@henrywinter What about condemning 3 chairmen Henry? I suspect there will be some angry fans out there.
themichaelowen,@LaurenceBellman Sounds like a plan!
themichaelowen,@LaurenceBellman Which lot? I bought lot 200 today.
themichaelowen,@LaurenceBellman you can't blame him. They were the best team that came in for him so he chose them despite more  being offered elsewhere.

themichaelowen,I guess West Ham fans will be happy tonight. Losing Parker is a blow but they have brought some top players in.
themichaelowen,@henrywinter You knew something I didn't! Roman Seal won at 16-1 and I never backed her. @TomDascombe told me she had a good chance too.
themichaelowen,What's happened this afternoon? Any big deals been concluded? Rushing home now to watch the final few hours unfold.
themichaelowen,On my way home from @QofS_Official. Great laugh. Can't tell you the result sorry! Will find out when it's being aired and let you know.
themichaelowen,@henrywinter just making sure Henry as I seem to be in their bad books so don't want to make it any worse!
themichaelowen,@henrywinter False Henry. Flew home on my days off to see my family as my Dad lived up there with me. Didn't fly in and out daily.
themichaelowen,"RT @RobboAdam: @themichaelowen I know you're a busy man, and a legend, but could you give me my first ever retweet today as it's my 18th ..."

themichaelowen,@chris_kammy I can't stop backing 2nd's at the minute Kammy. Only 2 weeks until The St Leger - Brown Panther is raring to go!!!
themichaelowen,Big game at Old Trafford tomorrow. Lads looking sharp in training. Arsenal still have some top players. Nobody underestimating them.
themichaelowen,Great result for Everton today. That's what you call pressure - taking a penalty in injury time when the score is 0-0. #ballsofsteel
themichaelowen,Suarez impresses me every time he plays. Top player. Bolton struggling to cope with him.
themichaelowen,@AnnaMBoyer Have a great day!

themichaelowen,@slagface_tommo: @themichaelowen there's an 'owen goes to pieces in box' gag there somewhere! &gt; but you know that's not true!!!
themichaelowen,Don't you just hate it when your daughter begs you to buy something then abandons it straight away? Now I feel obliged to do it.#cantbearsed
themichaelowen,Any tips except to turn the pieces over so I can see them followed by find the 4 corners and then the edge pieces first? 1000 pieces.
themichaelowen,About to embark on the biggest challenge of my life. http://t.co/vdz4g0X
themichaelowen,@physiojohngreen That's trying to keep up with me for all them years!
themichaelowen,RT @stevebrookstein: I don't normally ask favours on Twitter but @themichaelowen can you give a shout out  @themustardtree Brilliant hom ...
themichaelowen,@DianeDonald @Luke_Donald I can understand his excitement! Having sampled them whilst living in Madrid I permanently have them now I'm home!
themichaelowen,@piersmorgan zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.
themichaelowen,@kyevsMufc4Life I do mate but I get an average of 2500 tweets a day so forgive me for not replying to everyone who asks for a retweet!
themichaelowen,@piersmorgan Probably but I presume they are bored of replying to you as your repeat banter is draining.
themichaelowen,@DMHPartington It's mainly because they are polite and 80% of the messages sent to me tonight have been abusive.
themichaelowen,@SylviaSailo: @themichaelowen a sweet hello for all the MUFC fans here in India?? &gt; Hi everyone in India!
themichaelowen,"@andicarter07: @themichaelowen today is our country independence day, would you like to say hi to your fans in Indonesia :) &gt;Hi Indonesia!"
themichaelowen,@aaowen I seem to remember playing your mob last year. Hope you have improved a bit since!
themichaelowen,@aaowen I am starting to believe you! The Saints are on fire. Back where they belong next season? Too early to get carried away I reckon.
themichaelowen,I have watched dozens of games with these assistant referees behind the goal. Still not seen 1 of them assist the ref in making a decision.
themichaelowen,"@piersmorgan You are right mate. I'll be distraught. I mean, that will be the worst thing opposing fans will of ever said to me. #bothered"
themichaelowen,So annoying hearing the Arsenal Stadium announcer shouting the first names of the players for the crowd to shout their surnames.
themichaelowen,@jm_ralston Yes mate. Check out our website Manorhousestables.com for all the info.
themichaelowen,RT @Stephen_spend56: @themichaelowen please could you RT this? It's for @stjohnambulance # justgiving. Site http://t.co/hdkw2Gm thanks
themichaelowen,@MattyKWilliams I'm not convinced. Making the fences smaller will only encourage riders to meet them a stride faster and that is worse.
themichaelowen,There are some kind people in this world. Just had a parcel sent to the club from Yumi in Korea. My kids say Thank You! http://t.co/u0Z0OPs
themichaelowen,@TheNoseybonk He looks very sharp. Impressed but early days!
