amyjomartin,@MattWeinberger @KTsportsmarket @njh287 Need to experiment &amp; fail. That process leads to best practices. I've failed a ton. #SMSportsChat

amyjomartin,@LindaP_MD True story. I should have reached out to you for advice vs. my sarcastic friends. Ha.
amyjomartin,@ryanleecox If you liked that one then you like @AlanaGolob's humor. She went straight from nature &amp; injury to Brad Pitt. Ha.
