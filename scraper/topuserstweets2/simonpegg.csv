simonpegg,Peter Mullan and Eddie Marsan are similarly awesome. Paddy Considine is a national treasure. Tyrannosaur is essential stuff.
simonpegg,"Can't stop thinking about Tyrannosaur. Such an amazing film. Olivia Colman is stunning, a peerless performance. She must win EVERYTHING!"
simonpegg,"First act of the day, unwittingly put underwear on backwards. Felt something was awry, burst out laughing when I twigged I was bum-fronted."

simonpegg,Thousands of years of domestication and mutation just evaporated with a single corpuscle. She's more wolf now than miniature schnauzer.
simonpegg,Minnie's changed since we found those dead deer. She noshed a bit of offal before I could stop her and now she's refusing Science Diet.

simonpegg,Just to be clear I didn't give any of that stuff away. Anything that had real sentimental value was archived.
simonpegg,"All Tim Bisley's art. The original Bear designs from the show. Shaun's watch, tie and Dylan Moran's torn off head. I kept the sentimentals."
simonpegg,"It feels so good to have an empty attic. So much crap up there and some cool things too. Clapperboard from Shaun, Chocolate Beanie, a demon."

simonpegg,Yes I will occasionally read a bitchy mag in the make up chair at work but only because I get a perverse enjoyment from indignation.
simonpegg,Pull your head out Heat Magazine. Justin Fletcher is a fucking legend to parents and under fives. Works hard for kids with disabilities too.
simonpegg,That wasn't entirely a joke by the way. The Kaisers really did show up yesterday with a lot of other magnificent Londoners. #riotcleanup

simonpegg,Heard there were scuffles in my hometown of Gloucester. Hope eveyone's okay. I think the appropriate web-slang is FFS!!!

simonpegg,I totally stand by the 3D I've been involved with in Ice Age and Tin Tin. I think Narnia would not have lost any of its magic without it.
simonpegg,"Tin Tin will work in 3D because, combined with performance capture animation it will integrate with the story as part of the aesthetic. Nah!"
simonpegg,"Live action less so. The cinema foyer is in 3D and I can't wait to get out of there and watch a film. 3D is novel, not evolutionary."
simonpegg,"As I said, the 3D on HP7.2 should be avoided. Think 3D works with animation because it gives it a dimension we haven't seen in that context."
simonpegg,"HP7.2 SPOILER ALERT. I loved the way at the end, they didn't look 19 years older but they did look 19 times less fashionable."
simonpegg,It worries me actually. If marketing execs can inflict 3D on the most successful film franchise of all time they can inflict it on anything.

simonpegg,I'm on the floor of a fashionable West End eatery.
simonpegg,I'd love to make a sequel to Paul. Nick & I had a funny idea but even if we started writing it 2day. With shoot and post it'd be 3 yrs min.
simonpegg,@dannyjbrown Yes it's called Guten Tag Pet and it's all about the ghost of Jimmy Nail coming back to haunt Tim Spall as a talking brick.
simonpegg,Says the guy who likes bricks. Why you drop 'em if you like 'em so much? Huh? What's that? Bricks don't just disappear! Build another wall!!

simonpegg,"Sequel Tweet Pt 2. Didn't say sequels were a bad idea, far from it. Simply meant they're not always necessary. Certainly not with SotD & HF."
simonpegg,Where does this sequel obsession come from? Has our lust for the new been blunted by repeated pandering to childish desires for familiarity?
simonpegg,"Didn't mean to fuel rumours of a Hot Fuzz sequel. A high ranking MET police officer resigned, thus the comment about Angel returning to LDN."
simonpegg,@edgarwright He prefers to think his office is out on the street.
simonpegg,Does this mean Sgt. Nicholas Angel can come back to London? Because he doesn't want to. He's happy with Danny in Sandford.

simonpegg,"Maybe if we had celebrated his achievements and not called his girlfriend ""ugly"" he would have stayed. Not gone to NY. Not been gunned down."

simonpegg,"To all the 'comic book guys' who coughed, straightened their specs and pointed out the '51 original. This ain't a sequel to that now, is it?"
simonpegg,Liked the little sting from Carpenter's OST at the end of the trailer. Hope they match the deaths to the aftermath gimpsed in The Thing '82
simonpegg,"As a lover of Carpenter's original, I'm actually excited about The Thing '11. If they get it right, it's a worthwhile prequel. Hope they do."
