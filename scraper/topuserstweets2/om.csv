om,@mathewi there is a difference. in what he is saying and what your are saying. sorry but there is a role editors play beyond copy/subediting
om,@mathewi @lisanjutras but that doesn't mean peddling or shoveling shit to people.
om,@mathewi @KSpeicher i think they are NOT MUTUALLY exclusive. Process need to be solid so it leads to a solid finished product.
om,"@mathewi because some people can't write, others copy &amp; rip. news as a process doesn't preclude desire 4 quality. editors do more than erros"
om,@blam i am just old and have seen this movie before so know how it ends. too much spinning going on..
om,@blam i think this is more politicians taking advantage of what's hot.

om,@mg i know. it is only a matter of time before i win back the mayorship. :-)
om,"@ProfessorVC my point is that long term commitment is more than opening an office, and a PR bullshit blog post"
om,@ProfessorVC are you still there? I see your location is Palo Alto. @peterfenton
om,@peterfenton and that is the point. this is not an economic development move. it is more a tip to deal flow
om,"@alexn20 @peterfenton problem is that this is a movie that has been played before and when music stops, people leave."
om,@davidlee lol :) u know what I mean
om,"@FrankQuattrone you r going to open a office, declare ur civic duty? or just be straight up &amp; say: thats deals at @Benchmark  @peterfenton"
om,@davidlee didnt that coincide with your proper institutional fund :)
om,@davidlee @svangel @RonConway what is most?
om,@davidlee @svangel @RonConway so that means none of those companies coming out of ycombinator down south are counted to ur total?
om,@peterfenton again is very abstract. Lets see what change u bring. Also what is not to say u wont leave like all firms that left in 2002
om,@davidlee @svangel I dont buy it. I also think the watershed moment talk is nice except I heard in 99 and by 2002 all were gone
om,@davidlee  @svangel how far does your data go? What is the tax base impact of u guys. I see it as politically astute move for the mayor
om,@peterfenton explain to me how you impact that area? the mayor has basically made some vague assertions. how many are you hiring in SF?
om,@peterfenton seems like a good move for your business. i have a issue you with the political overtones.
om,"@peterfenton how many times have you walked Tenderloin? Twitter made this move a year ago, you are an investor there. why not then?"
om,"@peterfenton so if u say makes business sense for the firm to do so well great, but lets lose the civic duty veneer &amp; the faux-tech mayor"
om,@peterfenton I think that basically answers my question. The belief/bet is at a time when things are not obvious. Not when they are obvious
om,"@peterfenton if you want to bring change, ask the mayor to find a replacement for pier 38."
om,@peterfenton if you are committed what took you so long? Benchmark has been around for a long time and u been a VC for a long time too
om,"@peterfenton you dont need to have an office, make a big noise about it in order to do that. Your companies carry the seeds of change."
om,So lets call this what it is  a pr move and an opportunistic one on that.  @peterfenton
om,And lastly why did you take so long. If reasons you site are important they have been at work for nearly four years. Why now @peterfenton
om,Appease the mayor who is a faux  tech lover for it helps his fund raising efforts. @peterfenton Ask him what is done to replace pier 38
om,The question is @peterfenton will you stay in San Francisco after the market turns south. Sorry but this is a patronizing move to appease
