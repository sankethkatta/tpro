jasonsegel,RT @Jessikitten: @jasonsegel boyfriend asked what I wanted at Starbucks. I said surprise me. He threw the ring at me from across the tab ...
jasonsegel,"In honor of 5 year engagement, pls send your engagement stories in only 1 tweet and I'll retweet some fun ones, or maybe read on tv! Love, J"
jasonsegel,thanks a million. I wrote it with the director Nick Stoller so they had no choice but to let me do my acting too. That's my big trick!!
jasonsegel,"RT @nightbird2009: @jasonsegel ~ I'm so glad you were cast for this role ~ you look great, and this is going to be so much fun to watch, ..."

jasonsegel,Jeff who lives at home opens today! Please go see it if you can. I'm really proud to be a part of it. It's a little bit of everything.
jasonsegel,a very very happy birthday to my amazing kid sister @alibaby90 - I'm very lucky to have such an amazing sister and friend.
jasonsegel,"Ok, goodnight guys and thank you again for always being so cool to me. Jeff comes out the 16th and I really think you'll dig it. It's great."
jasonsegel,@rickygervais just said it was the best movie he has has ever seen. What an amazing compliment. Thank you so much man. It means a lot.
jasonsegel,"My previous philosophy was just to make a face that matches the words I'm saying, but the brilliant Duplass bros made Ed helms and I act."
jasonsegel,Tonight was the Jeff Who Lives at Home premiere. You guys will be proud of me. Go see it if you have the chance. I do acting.
jasonsegel,Almost a million of us now. Wanna see something cool? Call a friend. Say something  nice and mean it even if it feels dumb. It's rad.
jasonsegel,@rickygervais I'm pretty intimidating. My version of really sticking it to someone is vehemently insisting that they inspire me. Take that!
jasonsegel,@rickygervais we have created a bitter comedy rivalry. We are  Kim Kardashian and that forgotten basketball player. Let's go pay per view.
jasonsegel,@rickygervais I'm glad that's over. It's a good lesson for the kids in this modern world. Be careful before you're nice. No one buys it.
jasonsegel,"Well that was easy. I'm never saying thank you again. It spawns a 2 million person jail brawl for some reason. Anyway, you're the best ever"
jasonsegel,@rickygervais I love that somehow the mutual admiration society or at least the one side admiration society is viewed as a twitter fight
jasonsegel,"@rickygervais fair enough. Well I have no opinion that you made so
many amazing shows from the ground up and made me sit down and write hard"
jasonsegel,"@rickygervais sorry, I just realized you aren't following me which hurts a tiny bit but I understand. My last tweet was to you"
jasonsegel,Are we about to have some sort of wild west comedy tweet standoff? No one wins in this situation. Except me. But I was just saying thanks.
jasonsegel,"@rickygervais let's not get carried away with ""role model"" but you surely remind a young dude that the only way to make it is to work hard."
jasonsegel,Holy moly guys. The past hour or so of how kind you guys are to me is not lost on me for a second. I will try to pay it back somehow ASAP
jasonsegel,"We don't even know each other and you guys want me to be happy. I'm
not being sarcastic at all when I say that actually means a lot."
jasonsegel,@rickygervais hey man. It's Segel. I just wanted to tell you how much you inspire all of us who are trying to make it. That's all. Thanks.
jasonsegel,I'm also only accepting roles where I am sitting or laying down.
jasonsegel,"I've decided it's finally time for me to get a real ""leading man"" body. Like Marlon Brando in The Godfather."
