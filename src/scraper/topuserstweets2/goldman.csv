goldman,@drbluman @superfoot well that makes it interesting
goldman,@superfoot @drbluman of course. Kerry conceded on Wednesday btw
goldman,@superfoot @drbluman is the Romney team the sort that you think is going to give up easily? The Do Whatever It Takes Crew?
goldman,@robey Im pretty sure youre still on call.
goldman,"I dunno what the GOP answer to ""99 Problems but Mitt ain't one"" is. I bet it involves Bawitdaba tho'."
goldman,@drbluman @superfoot Wow - seems like someone must've done an overlay of that data to try to model the impact on turnout.
goldman,@drbluman @superfoot Yup - thats why I think itll be delayed. Theyll be litigation even in places like NJ to delay calling it/concession.
goldman,@drbluman @superfoot yeah a combo of 1) networks slow to call 2) actual shenanigans 3) litigation 4) actually being close
goldman,@drbluman @superfoot CO looks more suspect than VA ... but it's hard to trust VA cc:@mutgoff @autgoff
goldman,@drbluman @superfoot over/under on time of concession? I think Wednesday 3p EST?
goldman,"@superfoot Really tho its OH, VA and CO. The others are less close."
goldman,"@superfoot The under is a good bet. Basically, the over relies on Obama carrying FL which isnt likely."
goldman,My electoral math prediction - kind of a consensus call I think. http://t.co/LXO1Ca9E
goldman,@jzimbabwe true fact: I went to the barber today.
goldman,@baconmafia mostly ok here in manhattan. Worried about folks still without power bc it's really cold here.
goldman,@jrw maybe you can rig something to repost XBox live messages automatically to FB and save yourself some effort.
goldman,"OH: ""I'm gonna hafta go uptown to get my hair done. Look at my roots!"" Kvetching has returned to normal levels here in Manhattan."
goldman,@harryh ok word. I can't think of a way to make a good bet out of it. But I like betting on shit so maybe something will come to me.
goldman,@harryh no I believe Romney will concede *eventually*. He'll just hold out longer for legal challenges.
goldman,"@harryh no bet. defining ""won electoral votes"" while it's contested is too messy. Would consider action on ""what time Romney concedes."""
goldman,RT @Medium: Wow: https://t.co/Hg10iIDl
goldman,"@eparillon The flipside of #1 is ""The GOP is the party of white men."" Which will be a post-election narrative for sure."
goldman,Prediction: Obama wins 300 electoral votes but Romney refuses to concede on Tuesday because of ongoing legal action. #delegitimization2012
goldman,@drbluman good CSI'ing. I'ma call you to enhance all my shit.
goldman,@drbluman how'd they shoot the part on 6th ave w no power?
goldman,@stirman @sheckygreen yessssss

goldman,@drbluman fair. Here's a tip: don't blame the media. When has that worked?
goldman,@drbluman i agree it's poorly written but I'm surprised how much trouble it's caused. I mean didn't the coverage affect the decision?
goldman,@sippey it kind of broke my brain
goldman,Listening to The National's Boxer album and I had to lookup some tutorials to understand what's going on in the first track. (Goodness is.)
goldman,@phopkins I would definitely start w a dubious story about the needs of our agrarian society.
goldman,@pinwheel @dgcopter well that part was true! So maybe the whole thing is?!?

goldman,@drbluman NO SPORTSBALL UNTIL EVERY SUBWAY LINE IS BACK.
goldman,@drbluman word!
goldman,@drbluman I think that's consistent w what they've said. Been assuming tomorrow night.
goldman,@drbluman well if power is back on tomorrow then I should be able to subway all the way home. Maybe.
goldman,@tarngerine word. Thanks and hope to see you Monday.
goldman,@clove that's reassuring. Thought fuel shortage would be trouble.

goldman,@iano No one knows! Cats are sooooo secretive.
goldman,RT @TeaPartyCat: Everyone's a libertarian until their state is under 10 feet of water.
goldman,@pinwheel I think climate change has a greater chance of having a real national debate. Income inequality seems unmentionable.

goldman,@pinwheel you mistakenly typed that in the tweet box instead of the search box on RedTube.
goldman,You are first to act in a three way pot and check pocket aces on a A62 flop. Both players go all in behind you. This is a good feeling.
goldman,@sacca well you and this gentleman may have some interests in common. His solution was to not poop.

goldman,@stevej Yes - and HBO is a huge part for them. So Facebook might need to buy the whole thing.
goldman,Big prob: HBO relies on the operators for marketing. The solution is someone with even more money to spend on marketing partners/buys them.

goldman,@eparillon probably true. It's just after going over handlebars a couple times I started to think maybe it wasn't worth it.
goldman,@eparillon Used to bike to south park everyday. More than sweatiness was the feeling that I was going to wreck. Had a couple close calls.

goldman,Surprised to find out I'm only using 8Gb on my 32Gb iPhone. I guess never using it as an iPod means I should get the smaller ones.

goldman,@sam yup - a controlled faint. It happened to me a good number of times when I first started working out. Been awhile tho'.
goldman,"@mrtall now that you mention it, I was sweating black pudding just before the incident."
goldman,@narendra he actually did wrap me in towels and bring me an orange juice after massaging my back. We have a tender relationship.
goldman,First time back at the gym in over two weeks and since turning 35  actually fainted.

goldman,Moving my entire portfolio into whiskey futures. http://t.co/gT5gWMSg
goldman,Best part of being jetlagged is waking up at 6a and feeling fully rested cause you slept 10 hours. Makes me wish I was a morning person.
goldman,@superfoot no way even odds to pick nominee and veep. Even if the favorite it's gotta be like 20-to-1.

goldman,Rugby seems the dominant vote for #2 sport in Europe is rugby. I don't even know if they have that in Amsterdam.
goldman,"Relatedly: is baseball now #5 in the US behind football, basketball, NASCAR and UFC?"
goldman,What's the #2 sport in Europe after football? Horseracing? Motorsport? Circus? I seriously have no idea.

goldman,@drbluman FTP has $243 of my money that I don't think I'll be getting back. Wonder if I can write that off.
goldman,"@drbluman It all just seems kinda true unfortunately. After 4/15, DOJ was like ""ok pay people"" and FTP was like ""Nah s'cool."""

goldman,@sean Never watched the shield. But I heard the good things.
goldman,AT&Ts best bulk int'l data rate has dropped from $200 for 200Mb to $200 for 800Mb. It's like a check cashing place dropped its APR to 212%.
goldman,@stirman Delegated!
goldman,@sean I can't think of a better one. I don't even know what's in second place. The end of MASH?
goldman,@seans23 Agreed. Probably can't be topped.
