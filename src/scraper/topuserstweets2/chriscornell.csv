chriscornell,"@Kev_F No, i was trying to wake up Jerome Harman who had fallen  asleep at his keyboard"
chriscornell,@Kev_F Most of the time a tour is booked around travel and markets that can support it. when its festivals it has to do with geography
chriscornell,@Di_McD That makes me feel very happy!!
chriscornell,@amarsinh John Mayer actually isnt on it but we became friends after the rumors started. maybe we will do something some day
chriscornell,@ThisIsRobThomas What are you out doing?
chriscornell,@Black_Fedora Its written from the perspective of an angry postal worker who goes to kill everyone at work. we rehearsed next to post office

chriscornell,@DMelsome He is brilliant!

chriscornell,@DrewCorley Thanks for listening!!
chriscornell,@HankMoodyBitch A friend of mine became famous was telling me how he couldnt surf in public places cause everyone wanted to ride his wave

chriscornell,@Pacisi this isn't a new thing. this happens all the time and in most cases the band or artist has no control over it. especially a festival
chriscornell,C @theBGRevolver
chriscornell,Happy Sunday to everyone! I'm at the park with my kids. It wants to rain.
chriscornell,@Nicolaspreuss yes!
chriscornell,@Jon_Favreau thanx for rubbing it in superstar!
chriscornell,@DAChesterFrench how can I here your music ?
chriscornell,a few years ago this part of my evening would be solely dedicated to getting as drunk as possible. now i just eat. xoc
chriscornell,@Mayra_M i will check it.
chriscornell,I think asking about cool music is the best application i have come up with in this forum. love film but with children its pay per view only
chriscornell,@tw3nty3ight im so sorry . I cannot imagine what you feel but you have my prayers. god bless! hang in there!
chriscornell,@realSethRogen 666
chriscornell,"@TSherwood for me its the same, so whatever is best for you!"
chriscornell,"@TSherwood it depends on the artist and the structure of the record deal, that is if they even have one. Plus each download site pays diff."
chriscornell,I am a fan of music first. What records can anyone recommend new or old. Especially new!
chriscornell,@firaswahbeh yes. I have been doing acoustic versions of 4 of the new songs here and there. How is Dubai
chriscornell,@Piringo thanks!!
chriscornell,@KenCC it does unless the people are cool and want to talk. Most of the time they don't seem to. Thanks for the props! And cheers to band!!
chriscornell,"@teddy07x I am with you! Its hard to say anything in detail with 140 spaces. Shit, I have 48 left. Well now only 25. I guess we should blog."
chriscornell,@ijeffgarden that's fine!
chriscornell,My son is singing the Jazz standard song in Spider Man Three. Its interesting that he keys in on a song like that. He loves it. And sandman
chriscornell,Thanks for the Leno props It was the best time I have had there. Jay and all the guests were very cool. Usually the guests are super uptight
chriscornell,@campingjason you are right... that is until your lungs pop up into your head and work their way to the top.
chriscornell,"That was that. Seth Rogen is very nice, so is Guy the Chef."
chriscornell,I just signed Leno's guest book. Obamas is the page before mine. If I were a real rock star I would steal it. I disappoint myself sometimes.
chriscornell,"@chmoller I just did an interview with a Dutch journalist named Bart. He said ""if you are standing still, you are falling behind"""
chriscornell,The only thing interesting about the Leno catering is that they have perfected the art of the mini fridge temp. The drinks are almost frozen
chriscornell,"@JohnASuarez     I can think of 6. ""Can't change me"" ""Be Yourself"" ""you know my name"" ""silence the voices"" ""Long Gone"" Scream"""
chriscornell,Just did the souncheck. Very quick. Missing keyboard player.
chriscornell,They make you show up early cause they get nervous. A driver once told me that some guests will freak out and bolt from the car. Wierd.
chriscornell,How many times have I played Leno? Once euphoria morning. Once Audioslave. Once bond theme. Is this 2 or 3 with this line up?
chriscornell,"I'm at Leno now. Getting rea5y for Soundcheck. He drove a ZR1 vette today. Go to ""Leno's Garage"" site to see all his rides!"
chriscornell,@HarjKM Ben Stiller told me that. He wasnted to remake the movie but he couldn't get the rights. I love the original. Great singing!
chriscornell,I hope the red and blue get a purple thing going. I know its hippie but everything comes in cycles. Hope! Hope! Hope! hope!
chriscornell,@bleak22 I meant his fans on average.
chriscornell,I'm getting ready to watch Obama on Leno. Garth Brooks is the musical guest. Red state music. Blue state Pres. Breaking down the barriers!!!
chriscornell,@xiape he was blonde
chriscornell,@cath68 that makes me feel better. If its a job I get it. If its walking around trying to make people think he is because he looks like it?
chriscornell,@jimiheath let em try!
chriscornell,@SylviaHeins that's it! South Park. He looked just like that. Im sure his voice would be the same.
chriscornell,I don't want to Fight with anyone ever again. But I am going to
chriscornell,I saw a fake Jesus walking on Sunset last night. He was so well turned out that he looked like he walked out of a broadway play named Jesus
chriscornell,@blakeyourface thanks!!
chriscornell,@funkymonk84 good guess. I watched part of it last night. I've seen it before.
chriscornell,@JunkyKid thank you! I am texting and driving. Totally wrong!
chriscornell,I had shrimp last night again. Thought you should know. Ryan Gosling is a good actor. Peace out
chriscornell,@Crow74 yes! Go to Chris Cornell.com and check dates. Thanks!

chriscornell,@MightyJordan its not released everywhere yet.
chriscornell,@elrente not sure how long my set is but I play songs from every album. Old and new. Every night is different. Can't wait to get back there!
chriscornell,"Sorry, I've been away from bb
Can't wait to see Leno tomorrow. Thanks for this week! ""Scream"" in the top 10. Leave on Monday. 66 shows  ..."
chriscornell,The largest A.I.G. Bonus I saw was 6.2 million. Which idiot at a company that needs all our money to float deserves that?
chriscornell,Obama is on Leno Thurs. I am on Fri. so I cant ask him why he doesnt go take the A.I.G. bonus money back. this is taxpayer money.
chriscornell,I haven't seen any responses from jail so I guess its mostly a no. I follow pres. Obama but he doesn't seem to personally post.
chriscornell,Anybody know if you can twitter from jail?
chriscornell,who wants to believe in reincarnation? I like the idea depending on the circumstances. New age people  think we choose our lives. I don't.
chriscornell,@guitarkadia it was more of a taste
chriscornell,once when I was nine I dropped a lit match in to a big box of stick matches. It blew up and a black cloud of smoke went in my lungs.
chriscornell,"@RYAN_manno thanx, see you soon"
chriscornell,@zerovski thanks !
chriscornell,@alamos you rock!
chriscornell,@TPN321 reading that helps me
chriscornell,i don't think he would where sandals. he would where what ever makes sense for where he is.
chriscornell,@LeArmoire thanks for that!
chriscornell,@DannyLeon what ever works. If you don't yave an idea just hang out with a guitar or piano or bass or whatever until you do. Always works!
chriscornell,@govindk21 thanx!
chriscornell,My boy wants the flying snowboard looking thing that harry rides around on in Spiderman 3. I put him on my snowboard. He's not buying it. :)
chriscornell,I'm at a movie with my babies. Thanks for all the questions! I answered a bunch on Skee tv. Thanks for the possitive thoughts as well!! C

chriscornell,@Vness79 ill be back in Chicago April 19th
chriscornell,Just got back. We stopped at toys r us to pick up something for our babies. On our way home now. Can't wait to see them!
chriscornell,"Anyway, the new Jesus can have any name he wants as long as his last name is Christ. I like Max."
chriscornell,The chicago airpot terminal smells like BBQ sauce
chriscornell,The next sign will be a man with a kind face and sandals (Nike makes a nice pair) and will have to be a Jew for masianic elegibility.
chriscornell,It may be that the second coming is very soon. All the Christian tv shows are convinced. The first sign will be an anti Christ.(Evil person)
chriscornell,"Other Jesus Twitters. ""Why are the Jews and the Romans so angry with me, and who is this Mel Gibson?"""
chriscornell,"What do you think Jesus would twitter? ""Let he who is without sin cast the first stone"" or ""Has anyone seen Judas? He was here a minute ago"""
chriscornell,"Sometimes in the morning  I look out across the day,and I see the fist fight between the wind pushing me back and the sun calling my name."
chriscornell,Thanks to all my fans for supporting me as I venture forth into the future! You are the best fans in the world!!! See you out there! C

chriscornell,I just did a morning tv show in denmark. I performed and presented at an awards show last night. The people here have been very good to me.
chriscornell,Hi all. I have decided to stream my whole album for a limited time on My Space so you can hear the whole thing the way it is meant to be. :)
chriscornell,On a flight to Berlin. Its raining. I miss my children. Scream is starting to translate. I love it.

chriscornell,Food poissoning. Can happen anywhere but seems to happen here a lot. Its Sun. Things are very quiet on sun. We have to take the chunnel . X0
chriscornell,"I just came from the market.
You have to bag your own groceries. The food is fantastic when you have been away for a while."
chriscornell,Just arived in Paris. Haven't been home in a long time. Feels nice. We missed all of the cold weather!!! What a great city. Its 8pm on fri.
chriscornell,"Just got my mobile working again. Sorry! We are at the airport. On our way to Paris. Starting a 2 week promo tour for scream.
Get to go ..."
chriscornell,Security sent me to the wrong entrance. I ended up at the Staples center back stage. No pass. Huge security. Good thing I wasn't a stalker.
chriscornell,Now I just saw a squadren of helecopters. They look scary in a group. Nothing positive is happening when helecopters are in groups.
chriscornell,Going to a rehearsal for tonite.  Lust saw an add for a storage company on a weather balloon.
chriscornell,Now I am rehearsing again. It has been raining all day. Reminds me of Seattle. You think it will never stop.
chriscornell,I just ate shrimp
chriscornell,"Its raining like a bitch now. I am practicing ""Kentucky Woman"" for Neil Diamond tribute at a Music Cares event tomorrow."
chriscornell,Hi. Its Sat. Its like summer here. I guess that's good.
chriscornell,I once lived next to a crack house. The dealers spoke in a system of wistles. I would listen late at night. I am trying to write a song  ...
chriscornell,And don't for get the ceiling. It never stops watching. On your death bed you will finally look back. You will be sad to see it go.
chriscornell,"ce. Or your own shoes and your own face. 
   Hi."
chriscornell,"ieling. What is it like? What color?
Carpet or no? Is someone talking to you? Near you?

chriscornell,"Hi. My name is Chris. I just got my phone working again. Sort of.
