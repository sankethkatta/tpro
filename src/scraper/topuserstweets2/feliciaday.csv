feliciaday,That laundrymat is in Silverlake off Sunset.  I bought everyone strange Korean desserts from a weird place across the street. We got sick.
feliciaday,"That extra later taught us all the Superman dance in the parking lot, so it's all good #drhorrible"
feliciaday,"One extra in this laundry scene could NOT close that dryer in time with everyone, it took more takes than all the actual scenes #drhorrible"
feliciaday,"I got hired for #drhorrible 5 months later with one email from Joss: ""can you sing? ~j"""
feliciaday,"One of the art PAs on #drhorrible was the production designer on @theguild Leah Mann, and she made that melted good in the bag!"
