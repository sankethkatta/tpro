wossy,@carolem00 it's just embarrassing.
wossy,@RealRichHardy yes. It was.
wossy,@Cfeetsrevenge because its true. And he perpuates the bullshit cliche that all men want to shag around for most of their life. Embarrassing.
wossy,@iansums hate the bullshit nonsense that its somehow admirable desirable to shag around your whole life. It's feeble.
wossy,@Cfeetsrevenge it was in fact neither.

wossy,@media_lush I'm not defending them. I just refuse to join your attack.
wossy,@media_lush you really are quite ridiculous.
wossy,@media_lush sure. I am not. But it shouldn't be anyone's business.

wossy,@markpatv the answer lies within.

wossy,Good morning. Jet lag woke me at. 5 buy there's something very pleasant about warm cities before everyone's awake...
wossy,"@tammyinlalaland I didn't say that. Of course people have. But faith is a) subjective, and  b) more complex then just right or wrong."
wossy,@media_lush I'm not defending anyone. Just saying I  have no more problem with people choosing to (cont) http://t.co/tMc930Hh

wossy,@media_lush so do you endorse everything that Muslims or Catholics do? If not I hope you're equally strident in your attacks.

wossy,@media_lush I respect the wishes of others to follow whatever faith they believe speaks to them. (cont) http://t.co/BofXthDu
wossy,@media_lush I've never supported them. But I afford them the same respect I afford all belief systems which others hold.

wossy,@prodnose last time I got drink listening to punk I was with Vic reeves. We cut each others hair. I looked like Roy Kinnear...
wossy,"@prodnose you never normally swear so casually. That's for less brilliant types. Rumour is you're drunk, punk and disorderly."

wossy,"@tonyfish rather extravagantly I have both, to try and avoid the inevitable hiccups."
wossy,"@leastweknowthat I wasn't very happy back then.  Now am very content. So , now,"
wossy,@missattitude198 that was terrifying. I felt so bad for the poor guys that didn't get through. I would have got that word wrong as well!!
wossy,@SarahJohan6 no they didn't.
wossy,@AndyDekka formerly of the Daintys. Very talented and nice man.
wossy,@LFCKaren nothing. How horribly cynical you are.
wossy,"Jane favours the Fuller Fig by the way. As do I, if you  know worrimean......"

wossy,@surferdwb don't want to jinx it.
wossy,@MRKOROMA Erm. No. For sizzle!

wossy,@surferdwb still hoping so I can't say.
wossy,@MRKOROMA true dat.
wossy,@PunkLuke to check.
wossy,@Scottbows1970 yes. I lived there. But never  knew you or your family I'm afraid.
wossy,@Scottbows1970 sorry.
wossy,@MRKOROMA both.
wossy,@ErikJLarsen yes it was good.unlike the Lizard in the new Spidey film. Looks like Koopa from the Super Mario Movie.
wossy,"@ErikJLarsen see, I loved the books. Well, about seven of them. But Gil Kane was incredible. His Name Is Savage!!!"
wossy,@joekeatinge definitely. I'll try to dig out the Dune for you. Might be on laser disc though!
wossy,@ErikJLarsen noooooooooo. I liked the dog and the cgi was good but the script and acting stunk. Worst Dejah Thoris imaginable.
wossy,@PeterFlynne only if I can sit down.
wossy,@PunkLuke no. It really isn't.
wossy,@joekeatinge you at sdcc?
wossy,@_JohnBailey competent but bland with bad cgi
wossy,@AllezBartoli maybe. But having met and spent time with Jodormowsky I can substantiate the rumours. He's certifiable.
wossy,@MarkBDesign no. It's worse.
wossy,@Scottbows1970 nope.
wossy,@Hayley231 first you must love yourself.
wossy,@joekeatinge ....with him. The frosty dislike between him and Rafaella DeLaurentiis was kind of awesome...
wossy,@joekeatinge it's just one see. Shows where the Fremen keep their water supplies. I met Lynch at that time and researched an interview...
wossy,@joekeatinge yes. And I have seen all the different cuts. I love the extra scene under the mountain. You seen that? In the Japanese version
wossy,"@kaitlinpitcher 
Directions, Poppy Red  flavour. Although at the moment it's a light pink.

wossy,#wimbledon. Close the roof you idiots.
wossy,@benchettle thanks! Very kind of you.
wossy,@benchettle not long now. Bryan just polishing it. Maybe 2 or 3 weeks. It's the best issue do far I think. New characters appear!

wossy,@suchprettyeyes as long as they write their own lyrics. And dress for themselves...
wossy,@BerlinAde yep. You know it.
wossy,@HoneyKinny why do people keep mistaking me for Ryan Gosling? It's so annoying.

wossy,@glancee why?
wossy,@jimmyaquino Thats a very good reason NOT to.
wossy,Writing at home is fun but it's SO easy to forget to shower.The fact that even the  dogs leave the room when i walk in has given me a clue.
wossy,@alexmitchard811 nice!!
wossy,@worldofagwu The King will never die.
wossy,@MickStatham_ Thats probably why they put her in there. Jim is one of the best for sure.

wossy,@dawespaul Cover to Shadow 2 by Kaluta.
wossy,@MickStatham_ The other is the version they printed. They have one totally different figure in! KaZar was replaced by Black widow!
wossy,@MickStatham_ Whats interesting is those posters by Jim are different. One is the study he did before completing the finished art.

wossy,@PleasantPirate Thats awesome.
wossy,@BisleyT I'm not actually defending them. Just saying it has never bothered me.
wossy,@IChingHex58 what judgement?
wossy,@jadejonestkd Good luck Jade and Good luck Team GB!
wossy,@IChingHex58 was he judged? Really?
wossy,"@IChingHex58 ultimately he'll be judged by his results, not the way he speaks or what a newspaper says about him."
wossy,@bradgreenPR and it doesn't seem to have stopped Mr Hodgson from rising to the top....so why the big fuss.
wossy,@IChingHex58 well thank you. I wasn't trying to disagree...just don't see why everyone's getting so het up about it!
wossy,@IChingHex58 but thats not true. i didn't ever get or lose a job because of my speech. Its a minor thing that people have picked up on
wossy,@benm_b Done.
wossy,@yocarlos84 no. And I didn't ask them to. I'm not backing them up. In my opinion it's a non-issue. It's up to them to justify what they do.
wossy,"@PaulGardinerDJ of course bullying is not OK. But I'm in the public eye, as they say, and if people want to talk about my speech that's ok."
wossy,@PaulGardinerDJ sure. But I never said it was.
wossy,@shrew69 I haven't seen it but I didn't support them. Just said it didn't bother me when people made jokes about my speech.And it doesn't.
wossy,@LongLiveRosex It is mad. Stop watching.

wossy,@CookingWithTwo Many thanks!
wossy,@CookingWithTwo Manchester and wales both a bit far away from me I'm afraid.
wossy,"@CookingWithTwo Maybe.Where are you? Not tonight btw,.. but i am happy to support students..."
wossy,@DoktorWatson I wish but not sure. Love those guys. Both so smart.
wossy,"@Kaiser2702 But they are the same people who gave Graham Taylor the job. So, ipso facto...."
wossy,@DoktorWatson But really not a big deal. I wish we weren't part of such a judgmental culture.
wossy,"@liamjtaylor1 I am very sorry to hear that. I remember now ...It was on my Sunday night show wasnt it? Not orchante, so apologies..."
wossy,"@DoktorWatson It just shows them in a bad light. But it was clearly a joke, albeit an obvious and rather unfunny one."
wossy,@DoktorWatson Life's too short.

wossy,@SarahThurogood Chomskey squared...
wossy,"@Phaz1980 Well, I never knew I couldn't pronounce it until the papers pointed it out. But in the real world it's not worth complaining about"
wossy,@aaronjohnstrath  Mass political democracy as a concept. Its a placebo...
wossy,@tooauldnfat I ws polite and friendly. They are just trying to do their job. I was on the receiving end once but didn't take it personally.
wossy,@aaronjohnstrath Thats the point. Democracy doesn't exist. We are being held to ransom....
wossy,@lulusayers I quite like Boris.

wossy,@Schofe I bet you still look freshly pressed....

wossy,@Siobhan4Mayor Good luck. You have Jane's vote as well
wossy,@tom_watson You might not like the answer.

wossy,@luise_g I hear you. And am listening.
wossy,@PuffyZA I was insensitive and that was wrong. As ever am working towards being a better person.
wossy,@superpokey77 hi. Didn't see your first tweet. We aren't starting on that for a while. So can't offer you anything. Soz.
wossy,@superpokey77 that's quite some claim...
wossy,@PuffyZA I'm actually meeting with a TS acquaintance and a blogger on the subject to discuss.
wossy,@PuffyZA when was I callous?
wossy,@SarahTMW Fair enough. Thanks for being so reasonable.
wossy,@hlb77 hello. Have a nice evening.

wossy,@jackofkent hello. I have something to send you . Where is best address?
wossy,"@monsterstomp the intention was never there to upset, and i regret my thoughtlessness. I am all about acceptance and equality for all."
wossy,@vicgoddard too late. I'm wearing it.
wossy,@Raphaelite_Girl yes I did. It's kind of great and kind of dreadful. But mostly great. Not sure if I still have it though.
wossy,@Button_76 he is on week after next. We record this week though
wossy,@DrDalim I just tried it and it worked....
wossy,Now THIS is what we need on Saturday night tv...http://t.co/O8DK30LO
wossy,@nicholsonuk your intelligent and considered response has been duly noted.
wossy,@aymeeee_ although percentage wise have met a lot more awful heterosexuals! Good night
wossy,@aymeeee_ although I have met two or three who were just horrible.
wossy,@aymeeee_ enjoy!
wossy,@aymeeee_ splendid.
wossy,@essjayarr it's cool. Although she is that and so much more of course.
wossy,@essjayarr yes. Why?
wossy,@aymeeee_ on the whole I like them. Yours?
wossy,@monsterstomp But the serious answer is that i did not believe the wound was genuine. Am prepared to listen and learn if I was wrong though
wossy,@monsterstomp I think they do now...
wossy,@SuzyMillerxo tragically that wasn't a disguise. I thought it was a good look....
wossy,I gotta go. Good night Twitter.
wossy,@oddbohemian Hah! But it's worth the wait....
wossy,@M1chelleEvans ITV around 9.30 I think. But it's on the ITV player all week.
wossy,@ethwhite Hope you have a good evening.
wossy,@ginandmilk_ Just playing. Soz.
wossy,@giagia Thanks Gia x
wossy,@Tishey09 Ancient.
wossy,"@Thom_JV_Malloy That was, I think, clearly the intention. And not negative or malicious at all. Hence my 'lighten up' comment."
wossy,@priscillajoy Naw. i don't really do 'team' when it comes to real life.
wossy,"@micalewis Hard though it is to believe, its natural."
wossy,@weezie_tyd youre very kind. And tolerant.
wossy,@oddbohemian That I have GOT to hear!
wossy,@LACIESFGL Yes. I am clearly dealing with my own gender-issues!
wossy,"@Thom_JV_Malloy I would argue that nothing should be off limits. You don't have to laugh but hey, thats what makes us free...."
wossy,"@giagia But you know, if people are upset I'll talk with them.  Only polite."
wossy,@priscillajoy What! The Muppets are  top quality!!!
wossy,"@Poptique I think that's most peoples strongest memory, unfortunately. Got your email. All cool. I'll call."
wossy,"@Brannigand I have heard Borgen is great. Loved tThe Killing, obviously. Nordic Noir rules"
wossy,@HendoWan Damn! Busted...
wossy,"@stiggybenaud slowly...need all the help I can get, obviously."
wossy,@Poptique yes. Went completely blank. I really like it despite the rather ripe performance from John Mills.
wossy,@shanekse85 we skirt around them...
wossy,@Garagefl0wer Performing. they actually did 3 songs. we will put the other 2 on the ITV website if the Monkeys say it's OK.
wossy,@harryWilliamz No I don't. Get grey in the beard when I grow it though.
wossy,@emilyburnside Don't start....
wossy,@S_Pug7 Brilliant! Love the name.
wossy,@jscottharris Oh. I forgot. Now I'm in trouble....
wossy,@weezie_tyd  The right to free speech should be reserved for for more important things then me being able to make a knob joke on tv.
wossy,@weezie_tyd The gag was perhaps cheap but it was not meant to reinforce stereotypes . Also I am not going to hide behind 'free speech.'
wossy,"In other news, Kermit and Miss Piggy are on the show tonight and I manage not to make any jokes about transgender people. Phew."
wossy,@polishtranbabe Many thanks. Appreciated.
wossy,@weezie_tyd I agree. And I try to ensure that i don't. And I don't think those comments undermined tolerance at all.
wossy,@Slinky_Milinky I don't want to fall out  or upset people who already have it very tough. Will read the Transgender link and respond.
wossy,@RozKaveney Iis it as simple as that.? Aren't  lack of education and bigotry and agression and many other factors as/more  important?
wossy,@notwaving Not trying to be edgy at all. That was a light hearted response to what iI thought was an overly extreme reaction to the joke.
wossy,@Sir_Olly_C Now you've lost me.
wossy,@pace Its a pleasure. Perhaps my thinking is outdated on this. But will read and get back to you.
wossy,@Robot96 You're right
wossy,@Sir_Olly_C appreciate it.
wossy,"@RozKaveney as I understood the news story, the airline hired and promoted their TS workers as a 'gimmick'. Hence the joke."
wossy,@pace Let me think on it and I'll respond.
wossy,@RhysGunter Hi dude. remind me tomorrow and I'll record that thing for you.
wossy,"@Slinky_Milinky I read it but disagree. However, if someone is upset of course it is regrettable."
wossy,@RozKaveney sure. Happy to. But please consider  difference between the subject and target of a gag..No malice or agression involved at all.
wossy,@RozKaveney I apologise for my naivety.
wossy,@rachel_norfolk Which I can understand. So apologies.
wossy,@Slinky_Milinky I don't think i saw it. Would you mind sending a link?
wossy,@Tabby_Adams we made a joke about a news story.
wossy,@Tabby_Adams Clearly not my intention though.
wossy,@jjjen I'm fine thanks.
wossy,@Tabby_Adams But you would really hold Little Britain responsible for the behaviour of some neanderthals?
wossy,@Tabby_Adams That's regretful. But I don't see a  direct link between a joke and someone's unacceptable behaviour.
wossy,@RozKaveney Okey Doke. I'll read and reply. Stay well.
wossy,@RozKaveney If that is really the case then of course it's wrong. But does it really ?
wossy,@RozKaveney feel free to react however you think apropiate. You know I'm not remotely transphobic.
wossy,Good morning. I am heading off to do Danny Bakers show on 5 Live. Here are my star guests on ITV tonight... http://t.co/HcidUD7I

wossy,@teambarlowgirl Thanks. Very kind of you.
wossy,@LiamKeogh69 he's very funny tonight.
wossy,But what is interesting is that this was first time doing a show since all the nonsense that I felt really relaxed again. Hope you enjoy.
wossy,"So my show is back tonight on ITV1 at 9.30. Lovely guests- John Bishop, Brian Cox, Lana Del Rey and olympic hopefuls Jade , Louise and Fran."

wossy,@JackMarty14 alright jack.
wossy,@HenryHamilton hope you like the show!
wossy,@KarenKibowen thanks!
wossy,@Alkusairi the Artist.
wossy,@EmeryBusfield thanks.
wossy,@craigmoultriePT I think superheroes work better in the American idiom.What I grew up with I suppose. Maybe one day I'll try to do a UK one.
wossy,"@Spacehopper69 she will be doing two I hope, one of which will feature on the new website for the show. I'll try to keep you posted..."
wossy,@DanTharley thanks for the link.
wossy,@DanTharley looks cool.
wossy,@nrodger I think so. Not certain. I let Bryan make the grown up decisions.
wossy,@EmeryBusfield so lve now been told! But I doubt it will be more than a superficial similarity.
wossy,@PIPPYJAM forbidden Planet do mail order. Not out until April though. Hope you like!
wossy,@Haha_tequila they sleep on your lap while you watch tv. But like really big dogs as well!

wossy,@comicbookevil hopefully the Gene Rodenberry future will arrive soon and we will all live in equal comfort and splendour  and pay no rent.
wossy,"@comicbookevil I can see your point. But it's nice to see it in print, old style."
wossy,@comicbookevil why not do both? But you are right. The industry is kind of at a crossroads....
wossy,@comicbookevil current movie version of Sherlock Holmes and tv version. Poles apart yet ostensibly the same . Room for both in my world.
wossy,"@comicbookevil but as my wife always says, ""it's all in the telling"". Character and tone and Di make ALL the difference. Example..."
wossy,@comicbookevil I'll ask around. But no one's in comics just for the money. Audience is too small really.
wossy,"@comicbookevil not only had it more or less been covered, but with same title!!"
wossy,"@comicbookevil about a super villains henglchman. Was going to call it Hench. Started working on it with Tommy, then we found out that  .."
wossy,@comicbookevil thanks. I hadn't heard of it. Will make sure we don't cover the same ground! It's weird. I came up with an idea last year...
wossy,@comicbookevil you didn't specify it had to pay the rent. All the artists and writers I know also work for film and tv.
wossy,@comicbookevil joe hill

wossy,@CescaMurphy and probably right
wossy,@CescaMurphy you are most gracious
wossy,@CescaMurphy this is boring. But the way it was used in the gag it didn't work. You would use the word 'wrote' in that sentence.
wossy,"@asafemooring if it's being used in the plural, as you just did, then yes. But you would not use 'written' for the singular."
wossy,@MarkvanReysen some were. But I didn't suggest it and you know it. I made a joke about David's wife after he made a refere ce to nazis.

wossy,@93rdElement I didn't deride hair colour. That's an actual news story and we showed a joke photograph. There (cont) http://t.co/cqgvylhL
wossy,@helsbells80 well it isn't a serious show. The news story is sadly a fact and we mocked up a photo. I didn't say anything negative at all.
wossy,@Dave02 hmmm. I think you must have misunderstood something. Perhaps deliberately.
wossy,@93rdElement what nonsense is this?
wossy,"@helsbells80 no one did, did they? Am confused. What are you referring to?"
