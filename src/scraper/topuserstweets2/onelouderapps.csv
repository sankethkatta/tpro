onelouderapps,@20Degrees LOL
onelouderapps,@TuckerBrennan cool!
onelouderapps,@andrewrowland Can't put it in a Slice but you can make it a Bookmark. So it will be accessible right from nav pane. :)
onelouderapps,@mchesse yes really....
onelouderapps,"@RockerStatus OK, something's up. I'm going to ask you to tweet @OneLouderCares. Matt is a Slices ninja and can troubleshoot you."
onelouderapps,@mchesse that is definitely on the way. :)
onelouderapps,@jimbo6ft10 try force closing the app or delete reinstall. :)
onelouderapps,"@RockerStatus Shouldn't happen, but if you are operating without much free memory, could slow down Slices. Does delete reinstall fix?"
onelouderapps,@texjoachim Next update this will be fixed. :)
onelouderapps,@mchesse good question. doing this would create extra calls to Twitter API and would make response time slower. :)
onelouderapps,@smithlorenzo Yep! :)
onelouderapps,@jimbo6ft10 Should still let you complete. Is this not the case?
