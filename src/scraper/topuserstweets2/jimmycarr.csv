jimmycarr,eating at 'breakfast club' in soho. Off to record some 'tweets' for a DVD extra - if you're interested http://tinyurl.com/nvl7uj
jimmycarr,well i don't have a big break - the 'rapier wit' tour starts thursday. & i've got a preview tomorrow - so i'm keeping busy & out of trouble

jimmycarr,I did my gig in Poole - signed some things & made it to the movie. It's just about to start & I've got pick & mix. Can't believe my luck!
jimmycarr,"1st man ""I'm spending the day in Poole."" 2nd man ""In Dorset."" 1st man ""I'd possitively recommed it"". A very old joke. I might open with it."
jimmycarr,Apologies. Apparently 'the passion of the christ' doesn't have a Hollywood ending. Its the same as in the book. Who knew there was a book?
jimmycarr,its just when i saw the 'Passion of the Christ' they did the classic hollywood ending - where the hero comes back after you think he's dead.
jimmycarr,obviously i've not seen Inglorious Basterds so don't spoil it for me. i don't want to know who wins WW2 or it'll ruin the surprise.
jimmycarr,just arrived at a nice hotel in Poole. i might try and see this Inglorious Basterds movie tomorrow. has anyone on twitter seen it? any good?
jimmycarr,Had a lovely afternoon wandering around Weymouth. Only 3 more dates on the Joke Technican tour - the end is nigh http://twitpic.com/dvj6t
jimmycarr,It's a slightly smaller venue that usual in Weymouth.  http://twitpic.com/duws2
jimmycarr,sounding husky really seems to fit whilst doing a gig in Essex. I'm just in the interval. Performing a new show - its like doing a joke exam
jimmycarr,i'm in Grays tonight doing a warm up show for the new tour. of course the old tour isn't finished yet i've still got three more dates.
jimmycarr,I'm doing a DVD commentary for Ed Brynes new DVD. Basically interviewing him & talking about comedy. What a lovely way to spend a morning
jimmycarr,i'm off to see a throat specialist today. I currently sound like I'm make an obscene phone call or acting in Eastenders.
jimmycarr,A TV presenter in Brazil was arrested for ordered killings to get rid of drug trafficking rivals & to boost his rating. i better be careful
jimmycarr,"I'm in Skegness & it's incredibly busy. Getting lots of funny looks  - not because I'm off telly, I'm just the only one without a tattoo."
jimmycarr,saw 'public enemies' today. its the story of a depression era bank robber set in the 30's. a modern day version would star the ex RBS chief.
jimmycarr,"The Britannia Theatre on the Pier in Yarmouth is actually very nice. But old, so very old. You want proof?  http://twitpic.com/d1wrf"
jimmycarr,I'm having as much fun on the pier as is humanly possible - a little bit. My face just looks right in this... http://twitpic.com/d1sso
jimmycarr,I've arrived in Great Yarmouth. I think this local shop could possibly explain the recent rise in violent crime.  http://twitpic.com/d1sho
jimmycarr,I just heard Twitter was down. Terrible - think of all the man hours gained. All that extra productivity can't be good for the environment.
jimmycarr,Truro is surprisingly busy today. I suppose it is 'the middle' of nowhere'. I'm off to the teaming metropolis that is Taunton.
jimmycarr,still nursing a sore throat. but enjoying a cup of lemsip. would it be wrong to try and do a line of the stuff? can you freebase nightnurse?
jimmycarr,Finnished my 1st show at the brilliantly named 'hall for cornwall'. It went alright despite my croaky throat. Hope I'm ok 4 the late show.
jimmycarr,On the way down to Truro. It's a weird 'bright grey' day. My voice is pretty bad - I'm taking alot of medication. Hope i'm ok for the shows.
jimmycarr,Jet lag & a night out in LA caught up with me. I just couldn't get to sleep. Watched 'we are klang' on iplayer at 4am & laughed alot.

jimmycarr,the idiots of ants (a very funny sketch group i hung out with in Montreal) interviewed me. if you're interested http://tinyurl.com/noq7kh

jimmycarr,I did some Go-karting with Ross Noble & Idiot of Ants today. I'm pretty sure I came last.  http://twitpic.com/bibl8
jimmycarr,@watsoncomedian is clearly on twitter. so i'll use this medium to ask Mark the following; are you up for go-kart action tomorrow at noon?
jimmycarr,did the midnight nasty show with Louis CK tonight. really fun. it felt a bit like 'late and live' back in the day. guess i'm getting old.
jimmycarr,I just heard John Cleese is performing on Sunday night. Which is great news because it means he's on the mend. Panic over.
jimmycarr,Just saw Aziz Ansari's show. Really funny & as a treat he performed for 10 mins as 'Randy' his character from the new movie Funny People.
jimmycarr,Montreal people are pretty cool. Great audience for the gala show even though Cleese couldn't make it. Lewis Black hosted & did a great job
jimmycarr,John Cleese is under the weather & won't be hosting the 'john Cleese gala' tonight. He's probably fine - just pining for the fjords.
jimmycarr,Drinking in a traditional Canadian bar. Pretty classy.  http://twitpic.com/b5xuv

jimmycarr,2nd gig of the night at Comedy Works. Kate Micucci was super funny & charming. I'm sure you can check her out on YouTube: search dear deer.

jimmycarr,I'm doing a nasty show tonight with Mike Wilmot my of my favourite guys.  http://twitpic.com/axzcb

jimmycarr,Ross Noble is currently giving a comedy seminar to Reservior Dogs.  http://twitpic.com/aup82
jimmycarr,Look who I spotted. I should really win a prize.  http://twitpic.com/auhg0
jimmycarr,Ross Noble did a great 12 min set. Normally it takes him that long just to say hello. It was ace.

jimmycarr,Tonight I'm at Absolute Comedy - I've managed to get onto a bill with 'The Canadian Masters' - I've changed.  http://twitpic.com/alf89

jimmycarr,RT @AbsolutePAP: @jimmycarr My favourite name for a hairdresser's is Curl Up and Dye
jimmycarr,Gordon Ramsays place at the airport is called 'Plane Food'. A bit like the barbers 'Fringe Benefits' or the chip shop 'the cod father'.
jimmycarr,"I'm at Gordon Ramsays in Terminal 5. He needs to use more local produce, simplify the menu & take his shirt off for no reason whatsoever."
jimmycarr,I'm on the way to the airport. I know America won a war of independence but do we still own Canada? Is it true that we're above their laws?
jimmycarr,off on a trip tomorrow to Canada's 'Just For Laughs' comedy festival and then to LA to do The Tonight Show. I can't believe my luck.
jimmycarr,we're considering changing 'the writers' room' podcast. any feedback would be greatly appreciated but we reserve the right to ignore it.

jimmycarr,"How could anyone see this headline & not read on. That's a story, I guess 'i love it'.  http://twitpic.com/99b2x"
jimmycarr,apparently I've been voted the 2nd most 'upbeat celeb on twitter'. which f**king sucks. I f**king hate coming 2nd. Oops I'm probably 3rd now
jimmycarr,off to savour the delights of the Las Vagas of the North West. 'What happens in Blackpool stays in Blackpool' Any ideas for a better slogan?

jimmycarr,i've just heard someone that worked for Michael Jackson say 'i knew one day he'd wake up dead'. not a great choice of words.
jimmycarr,just seen a pundit on the news talking about how Michael Jackson 'will always be with us' while Thriller was shown on screen behind.
jimmycarr,The BBC have 'breaking news on Jackson's death'. How is that even possible? unless he's walked out of the morgue like a thriller zombie....
jimmycarr,liking the Elvis style 'still alive' theory. is this 'death' thing just a career move? we'll never know. this is conspiracy theory gold.
jimmycarr,"i'm sure there are lots of conspiracy theories already - that london news conference footage - thats a look alike, right? maybe he's fine."
jimmycarr,i mentioned Michael Jackson this evening & was surprised at how sensitive people were. goes to show there's no such thing as bad publicity.
jimmycarr,i want to go and see this Banksy V's Bristol show but apparently there are very long lines. has anyone on twitter seen it? is it worth it?

jimmycarr,That was maybe a harsh review of Terminator. I did like the 'tin man' from 'the wizard if oz' who it turned out had a heart all the time.
jimmycarr,On a wet Birmingham afternoon Terminator passed the time. In one incredible bit of CGI the Terminator franchise turned to shit.
jimmycarr,Had Japanese food for breakfast. Actually in the movie right now. I don't think a 140 character review counts as piracy.

jimmycarr,not sure how many members of Burmas Military Junta follow my Twitter. I guess no more than 100. If thats you can you free Aung San Suu Kyi
jimmycarr,Aung San Suu Kyi won the Nobel Peace Prize. Which always reminds me of the Dennis Leary joke Id kill for a Nobel Peace Prize. Brilliant.

jimmycarr,So Wimpy called it 'a bender in a bun'. Surely they should move with the times and rename it 'a totally valid lifestyle choice in a bum' ;)

jimmycarr,This piss poor political 'scandal' is making me misty eyed for the days of amil nitrate soaked oranges & suspender clad death w**ks.
jimmycarr,The politicans expense thing is just embarassing. There are South American politicans laughing at our '23 for cat food' bullshit scandal.
jimmycarr,At lunch & the table next to mine had amazing looking scampi. So I asked the waiter to steel me one. They didn't even notice. That's service

jimmycarr,There's an article about twitter in the Sunday Times Magazine (magazines are basically loads of tweets put together & printed out on paper)
jimmycarr,Saw the 'Star Trek' movie yesterday. Simon Pegg makes it. Just as it started taking itself too seriously the comedy cavalry arrived.

jimmycarr,mentioning the new 'dvd' is now on sale on twitter seems a bit commercial but 'the writer's room' podcast is free so it all evens out.

jimmycarr,off to lunch with a few friends. i bloody love a bank holiday. i intend to eat a heroic amount of food. Can't believe my luck.
jimmycarr,Just had a look at the Wossy twitter and to his credit he posted this mornings score. Albeit with an excuse. Glad he enjoyed his lesson.
jimmycarr,just noticed a new 'writers' room' podcast has been posted on itunes. if you like people talking nonsense about nothing then you're in luck
jimmycarr,good game of tennis this morning with JR. He lost focus somewhat when a dog got stuck under a shed. Federer doesn't have these problems.
jimmycarr,"just recording the new dvd. really enjoyed it, its the audience interaction i really enjoy - i suppose those are the bits i haven't heard."
jimmycarr,'can you hear me?' is maybe the most pointless thing you could possibly say.
jimmycarr,The DVD set is all very modern. Should be fun tonight - who's not in a good mood before bank holiday Monday? http://twitpic.com/4hlwu
jimmycarr,"pointless things to say; 'no comment', 'are you asleep?'"
jimmycarr,Thinking about the most pointless phrase. Is it 'I'm lost for words' or maybe 'I'm speechless'. Cause clearly you're not if you said that.
jimmycarr,The gigs this weekend are in London. It's weird to be hanging round my home town before a show - it feels like a day off.
jimmycarr,Any ideas what I can call the next one? I want to continue the sentence but frankly I didn't think I'd get this far.
jimmycarr,Recording 'telling jokes' my 5th DVD. So if you put them side by side it'll be 'live' 'stand up' 'comedian' 'in concert' 'telling jokes'.

jimmycarr,played tennis this morning. i had a bit of a head cold and managed to convinced myself it was 'swine flu'. hayfever has fooled me again.
jimmycarr,Went to see 'in the loop' today. Turns out swearing is big & clever & f**king funny. I loved it.
jimmycarr,lots of questions about where i'll be playing on the 'rapier wit' tour. everywhere! this tour will have a carbon footprint like a wookie.
jimmycarr,I did some admin today. Spent the whole time singing 'skills to pay the bills' by the Beastie Boys. I've got so much growing up to do.

jimmycarr,I'm in the 'library' working. I say that I'm in a Borders flicking threw magazines I don't intend to buy - it's a brave new world people.
jimmycarr,i'm in harrogate this evening. its like there's been some terrible mix up and a bit of the 'home counties' has been transported 'up north'.

jimmycarr,"My new tour 'rapier wit' goes on sale today. So, erm, I guess, if you like maybe & don't feel any pressure but you could..... buy a ticket?"

jimmycarr,I asked Peter Andre 'what was the second thing that attracted you to Jordan?' He said 'the other one.' http://twitpic.com/3spsv
jimmycarr,Graham Norton show this evening. Peter Andre & Jordon stole the show. It was a bit like being a Relate Counsellor.  http://twitpic.com/3spee
jimmycarr,Don't cry nerds! I was only joking about 'may the force be with you'. I know 'star trek' is 'one ring to rule them all'.
jimmycarr,I'm looking forward to the 'Star Trek' film. 'May the force be with you' & all that.......what's that I hear? Sounds like nerds shouting.
jimmycarr,I think JR got over excited about the new 'Star Trek' movie. There's a thin line between tennis kit & fancy dress. http://twitpic.com/3rku6
jimmycarr,i'm about to go on stage in Southend. I would be in 'Southend-on-sea'  but the tied is out.
jimmycarr,"spent the day recording podcasts for ""the writers' room"" in covent garden. & drank so much coffee i fear i over shot my target heart rate."
jimmycarr,i just discovered I'm on Graham Norton with Jordan and Peter Andre this thursday. any thoughts on conversation starters gratefully received.

jimmycarr,I find myself in Maidenhead tonight. Doing a warm up date for the 'rapier wit' tour. Maybe that title promises too much? I guess we'll see.
jimmycarr,Baker Street is the worst -

jimmycarr,"just arrived in Salisbury - lovely town, nice venue but i can't get that Peter Gabriel song out of my head. does anyone else get that?"
jimmycarr,last night loads of people in the arena were waving at me. very flattering - until i spotted Jack Black in front of me. hang on to your ego!
jimmycarr,off to do a podcast today with some friends. if you're interested go to 'itunes' & look for 'the writers' room'. if you're not - then don't.
jimmycarr,I realize that going to see stand up comedy on my one night off is walking a thin line between loving my job & OCD. but i love it.
jimmycarr,i've got a night off tonight because the venue i play in Peterborough burnt down. off to see Russell Brand at the O2. can't believe my luck.
jimmycarr,in a 'chilis' having a very late lunch by the canal in Reading. Venice better watch out - they don't have a Krispy Kreme doughnut shop.
jimmycarr,My latest tour posters carrtoon has just arrived. Any thoughts? I thinks it's a 'smirk' this year.  http://twitpic.com/3enhg
jimmycarr,'seaman thieves' has been suggested as an alternative to 'pirates'. Sounds to me like a 'gentleman's special interest' film.
jimmycarr,it is odd that we called them 'pirates'. so very old fashioned. if you get mugged you don't call the bloke that did it a 'highwayman'.
jimmycarr,"French warship captures pirates. Presumably that only happened once theyd exhausted the retreat, surrender and collaboration options."
jimmycarr,How many 'man hours' are lost after every Bank Holidays to conversations that go 'is it Wednesday already? It feels like a Tuesday'.

jimmycarr,"Prisoners involved in the rioting are being moved. very rude that, interrupting someone in the middle of a sentence. Thats a RT. LOL"
jimmycarr,Sir Alan Sugar is not helping this country. unemployment is high enough without him firing someone every week.

jimmycarr,that prison riot is on the news. looks pretty bad. those guys want locking up.
jimmycarr,i'm watching The Apprentice on iplayer in a hotel room. i know i'm about half an hour from Grimsby but i couldn't tell you where i am.
jimmycarr,currently on a train to Grimsby - looking forward to the shows. something about a bank holiday weekend just puts people in a good mood.
jimmycarr,without getting boring about jokes i just think you have to look at more than the content - its all about context.
jimmycarr,"Jo raises an interesting point. i presume that everyone 'gets it', that everyone is in on the fact I'm only joking. but maybe not.."
jimmycarr,Jo Brand said i was 'sexist'. tempting to make a joke but you got to take criticism on board when its from someone you admire.
jimmycarr,i was only away for 10 days and i've come back to a strange land. Sky have changed the way the TV works. i feel like i no longer have a home
jimmycarr,"Just finished recording 'would I lie to you' with Lee Mack, David Mitchell & Rob Brydon. What a lovely way to ease myself back into work."
jimmycarr,Landed. Got home. 3 hours sleep. Showered. Coffee. Off to do 'would I lie to you'. Great break but I bloody love my job. Good to be back.

jimmycarr,RT @harrysougin: @jimmycarr  a bit like buying indulgences from the catholic church. yes Harry or the modern version 'carbon offsetting'
jimmycarr,I just think if u volunteer you should be allowed to commit a minor offence & get off. You've already served the community. Fair is fair.
jimmycarr,Volunteering is like community service for people that haven't done anything wrong. For people who 'want to be punnished' mildly - s&m lite
jimmycarr,The strange thing about my singing a hymn in a crowded bar with Clarkson on the piano; is everyone joined in. like a drunk school assembly.
jimmycarr,i just sang 'O little town of Bethlehem' with jeremy clarkson accompanying on the piano in a crowded bar. i fear i may be very drunk.
jimmycarr,This week I'm moving from relaxing on an island paradise to doing a show in Grimsby. Quite a gear change. But I'm   looking forward to it.
jimmycarr,Off to eat Brunch - a massive late breakfast. Basically breakfast for fat lazy people. No prizes for guessing it was invented in America.
jimmycarr,RT @fraggle35: @jimmycarr may be some sort of common wealth? - fraggle35 has taken it old school.
jimmycarr,"RT @xanderkale: @jimmycarr that'd be a pretty big building, you might need two of them. - good point well made."
jimmycarr,I've had an idea for the G20 leaders trying to repair the economy and promote peace. We set up some sort of 'world trade center'. Hang on..

jimmycarr,Just relaxing on the balcony. If it gets any hotter the suits coming off.  http://twitpic.com/2n2dq
jimmycarr,i'm on a thing called a 'holiday'. For me that means trying not to say anything funny for 10 days. Who's thinking 'no change there then'.

jimmycarr,"The clocks going forward is a massive waste of time. Thats almost a joke, with arts council funding & time & thought that could work."
jimmycarr,You know when you get Scottish money and people can be a bit weird about accepting it? Well it's not like that in Glasgow. Brilliant.
jimmycarr,I must say I like wandering around Glasgow. Something about hearing my name shouted in that accent just sounds right.
jimmycarr,I know there's a recession on. But who knew the Christmas Pound Shop would go under by march?   http://twitpic.com/2j1av
jimmycarr,Saturday lunchtime in glasgow and I'm just up. It's a really bright day. But I can't wear sunglasses in Scotland in march. I shall squint.
jimmycarr,Glasgow on a Friday night. I love a challenge. A heckler at the Empire in the 50's once shouted 'it's all very funny if you like laughing'
jimmycarr,I was all excited about seeing 'the boat that rocked' today & now I find it's not out till next week. Damn PR machines gone off early.

jimmycarr,just in the interval of the show in dundee. i feel a little guilty cause i've been slagging the place off all day and i'm really enjoying it
jimmycarr,@JayBroadsword LOL as the say. Bought my girlfriend a vibrator - all she's done since is moan. Well done Jay
jimmycarr,just been told Dundee is 'the city of discovery'. Presumably because the Discovery Channel made a wildlife documentry about the locals.
jimmycarr,I don't like to complain. But the Loch & the majestic hills are ruining my view of the carpark.    http://twitpic.com/2gs04
jimmycarr,"""i think of Dundee as the 'Paris of the north' because its covered in dog shit and nobody washes."" Good idea for an opening line tonight?"
jimmycarr,i'm still on a train. it would appear someone's put Dundee right up in the north - presumably so they don't bother anyone.
jimmycarr,Coke without the sugar or flavourings. Good idea. But if this clear liquid doesn't taste of anything won't people think it's spit?
jimmycarr,Tim Key is making comedy poetry funny again. I know. Who knew? like watching a genuinly funny mime artist. All the better 4 the surprise.
jimmycarr,What if there was a 'live feed' of the iplayer beamed into your house? So you wouldn't have to choose what to watch or when to watch it.
jimmycarr,I'm currently on a train to Dundee. Watching Charlie Brookers new show 'newswipe''. It's perfect - feels like a half hour in good company.
jimmycarr,"I won at tennis. 6-2, 3-6, 6-3. A change is as good as a rest. Weird how JR only post the results when he wins. I'm sure he just forgot."
jimmycarr,@artseyfartsey funny you should ask - I'm going to be playing the Toronto and Montreal Comedy festivals this summer. can't believe your luck
jimmycarr,@ycove thats such a great recommendation. i've been subscribing to 'the believer' for the past year. lovin' it. McSweeneys rocks.
jimmycarr,@lauraharrison i'm loving the indoor cash machine thats actually a person idea - lovely reverse inventing girl.
jimmycarr,i've had an idea. you know the 'i love you man' 'bromance' movie. well we make 1 but instead of a guy 'man-dating' he goes out with a girl
jimmycarr,well thanks for the literary tweets. I suddenly feel like a man of learning.
jimmycarr,@PetersTweets i saw a great A.A Gill quote where he described a haiku as being like a limerick that doesn't make you laugh.
jimmycarr,@posthamster i guess its true 'brevity is the soul of wit'.
jimmycarr,@mattgrylls you've got to at least mention Romeo & Juliets parents don't get along.
jimmycarr,apparently kids in primary school are going to be taught twitter. is anyone working on 140 character versions of classic literature?
jimmycarr,i was listening to the news on the radio driving home & some papers actually gone with the headline - 'inflation goes up'. thanks for that
jimmycarr,I'm in basingstoke tonight. The usual routine - in every sense.   http://twitpic.com/2ew7m
jimmycarr,did a pre show interview for 'would i lie to you' over lunch. ate pasta and talked about myself for an hour - a little slice of heaven.
jimmycarr,@Soupherb good gag. 'lol' as i believe folks are fond of saying on the 'titernet.
jimmycarr,@Soupherb i did try 'crazy golf' once. i'll be honest it wasn't as 'mental' as i expected.
jimmycarr,it's not about winning its about taking part. i don't even take tennis that seriously - i'm only number 4 in the U.K.
jimmycarr,i'll be honest the fact he played better and won more games made my decision to 'throw the game' that bit easier.
jimmycarr,just played BAFTA nominated Ross at tennis. i won the first set and then decided to let him have the next two. just being a bigger man.
jimmycarr,Woking on a Monday night - surprisingly up for it. Who knew?  http://twitpic.com/2dybu
jimmycarr,'Watchdog' the consumer show is on in the dressing room. is it wrong that i sometimes find myself rooting for the rogue builder?
jimmycarr,it should count as exercise if you changed into sports kit. which would mean Hull is the healthiest town - everyones got shell suit on.
jimmycarr,@unipede table tennis is a good idea. i've often thought it'd be the ideal sport for radio coverage. its very nice to listen to.
jimmycarr,tried to play tennis this afternoon but it was rained off. Do good intentions count as cardiovascular exercise? they bloody should.
jimmycarr,off to a 'sample sale' at my taylors. Very excited. Am i a highly developed metrosexual or have I actually crossed over into 'nancy boy'?
jimmycarr,@BiggusDoggus if Captain Cook was indeed born in Middlesbrough that might very well explain him fucking off to the other side of the world.
jimmycarr,"@AnonymousBotch yes, if the plan had been heading towards the big apple that would have been in very bad taste."
jimmycarr,And why is there a jet fighter outside the bingo. Protecting Nana from the invaders?  http://twitpic.com/2crn0
jimmycarr,I'm guessing the mayor of Woking is a 14 year old nerd. How else do you explain the tripod in the high street.  http://twitpic.com/2crf5
jimmycarr,Leeds to London on a train. Sounds pretty straight forward. But cancelled trains & bus replacement services have scuppered my modest plans.
jimmycarr,Middlesbrough last night Woking this evening. This should have been called the 'carbon footprint like a wookie' tour.
jimmycarr,Saw this bit of 'public art' in a middlesbrough park. A tribute to the 'outdoor lager enthusiats' who drink there?  http://twitpic.com/2bhmd
jimmycarr,walked around Middlesbrough and got followed by about 100 teens. Felt like a sort of emo/goth pied piper. All very polite and respectful.
jimmycarr,As you may already be aware in my five a day I count Jaffa cakes.
jimmycarr,Really? Really Leeds station? No ones cooking drunk in the station - stop frightening us.  http://twitpic.com/2ba30
jimmycarr,had a great lunch in Leeds. chicken & chips- classic. does anyone know why chips don't count in the five a day? it strikes me as very unfair
jimmycarr,In starbucks looking out onto another starbucks across the street. Is it just me that thinks that's a good thing?  http://twitpic.com/2b6rq
jimmycarr,Woke up in Leeds - which surprised me a little. Slept so well I totally forgot where I was.   http://twitpic.com/2b6kf
jimmycarr,heard a trail on radio 2 for a Stephen Fry documentary about how WW2 german boffins gave us rock n' roll. 'what the nazis did for us'?
jimmycarr,"it would be amazing if someone managed to 'hack' the inner city plasmas & put on a 'gentleman's special interest' film. come on nerds, do it"
jimmycarr,the real upside of the massive tv in the town centre trend is we can boast  we have the best informed homeless in europe. makes you proud.
jimmycarr,Photographic proof of Hull 'urban regeneration'. Next on the list is a sofa big enough for the whole town.   http://twitpic.com/2a9nj
jimmycarr,Hull council hasn't waisted money on fancy statues they've gone for a plasma. It plays news now but how long before the mayor gets an xbox?
jimmycarr,Train safety leaflet says ''don't walk on tracks; high voltage current dangerous' - nothing to do with the trains apparently. Who knew?
jimmycarr,I know it 'jumped the shark' long ago but I'm so invested in ER. Can they stop the drama and just make everyone live happily ever after?
jimmycarr,Retail Awards surprisingly fun. We didn't quite have a minutes silence for woolies but they got a nice mention.    http://twitpic.com/29i2z
jimmycarr,doing a 'corporate events' tonight. handing out awards to the retail industry. I might ask for a minutes silence for Woolworths. i miss 'em
jimmycarr,A few people let me know they were offended by some of my tweets. Maybe when I do it it's 'anti social networking'.
jimmycarr,Central Station on a brights crisp day. This statue outside seems to say 'Glasgow is the future - post apocolypse'  http://twitpic.com/28nmm
jimmycarr,Saw Nick Frost & Chris O'dowd in the hotel again today. Only it's a different hotel & a different city. It's like i'm pre-twitter stalking.
jimmycarr,Just doing my sound check in Glasgow and one of the tech team referred to the 'disabled seating area' as the 'cabbage patch'.
jimmycarr,out the window of the train the country side has gone all 'magnificent'.  'Country side' - sound like you've killed someone terrible.
jimmycarr,still on a train. thank god for the iplayer and junk food bought in train stations. i couldn't be happier.
jimmycarr,on the train to Glasgow. my lap top has decided to make R2D2 style 'bleeping' noises. i think i may be some ones 'only hope'.
jimmycarr,happy st patrick's day everyone. he drove snakes out of ireland. which is nothing. i've rid europe of its unicorn problem. Beatification?
jimmycarr,I'm first to arrive for todays podcast. Spotted a cool Banksy on the wall. It's basically an 'art joke' - me likey. http://twitpic.com/26j87
jimmycarr,Got back late last nights. 5 days post piled high in the hallway. It promised so much and delivered so little. A morning of admin - ho hum.
jimmycarr,monday night gigs tend to be a bit quiet. but for some reason Cheltenham are 'up for it' tonight. i can't believe my luck.
jimmycarr,Check out Cheltenham town hall. I believe that's a 'duck egg blue'.  http://twitpic.com/25u3l
jimmycarr,Cheltenham has a giant brass bull with it's arm round a bunny in the highstreet. Or there's something in the water. http://twitpic.com/25sl3
jimmycarr,Got to meet some pretty amazing men today. Proper heros with proper war stories. Guys blown up a few weeks ago now joking about it. Wow!
jimmycarr,just saw Chris O'dowd & Nick Frost outside the hotel. Their the nicest most down to earth men. Out promoting 'the boat that rocked'. V cool
jimmycarr,"@TLHobo That's a good point. Maybe it should be 'stop hunting, polar bears'. Those bastard bears kill loads of seals - it's a disgrace."
jimmycarr,"The front of the independent says 'stop hunting polar bears!' so, that's freed up Tuesday afternoon. Might try a spot of seal clubbing."
jimmycarr,"I bought new shoes yesterday - I know, it's exciting. The thing is they're making an alarmingly loud squeeking noise with each step."
jimmycarr,"just having breakfast in the malmaison in birmingham (know it's late but I work nights). Military hospital, show in cheltenham, then home."
jimmycarr,I'm off to Selly Oaks tomorrow to visit war heros. It's a weird one because I feel privileged to be asked but I know it'll be humbling.
jimmycarr,From Manchester to cheltenham to Birmingham today. I'm really getting value for money out of that road tax.
jimmycarr,I'm excited by the tv listing. Stewart Lee returns to bbc2 tomorrow night. Isn't it great when good things happen to good people. Big up!
jimmycarr,It's all gone a bit 'Stella Street'. Just saw Wayne Rooney in reception. He must be pretty good at 'kicking soccer ball' if I recognize him.
jimmycarr,Just bumped into Ed Byrne in the hotel reception. The big downside of touring this much is I don't get to see other peoples shows. Ho hum.
jimmycarr,read the paper and reached my target heart rate for the day. I've just got to eat a roast and drive to Cheltenham - I bloody love Sundays
jimmycarr,I'm in Warringtons 'cultural quarter'. No disrespect to this fine town but maybe a 'cultural 8th' might be a more fitting name.
jimmycarr,Just bumped into Chris Hoy the gold winning cyclist. I think it's even more impressive that he got gold in china -everyones got a bike there
jimmycarr,I was humbled at the show last night. No matter how well I deliver a crafted one liner it's never going to be as funny as a guy falling flat
jimmycarr,Manchester is quiet. Apparently 11 guys from here have challenged 11 guys from Liverpool to a game of ' 'soccer ball'. people are watching.
jimmycarr,I guess it could have been worse given the date. A swollen foot doesn't really compare to being carved up by a pyscho in a hockey mask.
jimmycarr,A set of steps at aberystwyth university appear to lead nowhere. a metaphor for what the uni can do for you?  http://twitpic.com/2295q
jimmycarr,Backstage in aberystwyth a counter top has just collapsed and landed on my foot. It didn't tickle.   http://twitpic.com/228y4
jimmycarr,Worth the trip. What a friendly place. I stopped into a coffee shop for directions and got walked to a lovely deli. http://twitpic.com/222ko
jimmycarr,@chris_finney914 thats a nice bit of 'reverse inventing'. sky sports 'super sunday' but in some sort of stadium with a crowd- its a thought.
jimmycarr,Just filling up on the long drive to Aberystwyth. I'm not sure this picture does the natural beauty justice.  http://twitpic.com/2221a
jimmycarr,spotted these marking on the ground. But which to follow for couage a heart and WD40?  Come on birmingam give us a clue ://twitpic.com/21x94
jimmycarr,about to drive to birmingham. breaking the long journey to aberystwyth for tomorrow nights shows. any suggestions for breakfast in brum?
jimmycarr,I feel defeated by Italian food. When I threw my napkin onto the table it was like a boxer throwing in the towel.
jimmycarr,Just won the tennis against Ross. Makes a pleasant change. I will now endevour to eat enough chocolate to undo any good I've done myself.
jimmycarr,i don't want to sound 'hobophobic' but the clean cut beautiful sounding 'Fleet Foxes' look like they spend alot of time drinking in parks.
jimmycarr,@mighty_memma good point well made. all tanks are 'killer tanks'. i guess maybe they thought people would think it was a show about fish.
jimmycarr,watching 'Russian constructivism' review on the culture show. feeling very middle class - but 'killer tanks' on discovery is calling me.
jimmycarr,"FM has got Ladyhawke as a guest - i'm loving the chris o'dowd, kevin bishop combo."
jimmycarr,i'm really tired and i really want to go to sleep. but i feel compelled to search for entertainment. come on sky+ work your magic.
jimmycarr,@jo_maycock i think the next dvd is going to be called 'telling jokes'. it'll be the material from the 'joke technican' tour.
jimmycarr,@DebyP i'm actually from Slough - or 'near Windsor' as the locals call it.
jimmycarr,about to walk on stage. for some strange reason Darford shows starts at 7.45. its probably got something to do with curfews and ankle tags
jimmycarr,"@tirythb yes one of the sound men is at the piano, knocking out some stevie wonder classics whilst the lighting gets done. all very pleasant"
jimmycarr,"I'm in Dartford. In a lovely little theatre tonight. As for Dartford itself, it'll be lovely when it's finnished.  http://twitpic.com/208fb"
jimmycarr,Well the salad lasted about as long as my good intentions. Pizza has arrived. Who knew cheese on toast could be this delicous & calorific.
jimmycarr,eating salad in a pizza hut - it's a super efficiant mayonaise delivery system.  Maybe it'll rid me of the bitter taste of tennis defeat.
jimmycarr,Saw Red Riding - loved it. Great 70's period drama - but cost alot. I've had an idea-a 'period piece' set in 09-filmed now but shown 2045.
jimmycarr,@Astranought that really made me laugh. i've got so much growing up to do...
jimmycarr,@Lonesbones well that is a classic. vintage gag.
jimmycarr,@ChristinaTwit i'm both happy and sorry about that.
jimmycarr,My cat appears to be checking the house for radioactivity - well it's certainly up to something it's purring like a geiger counter.
jimmycarr,Oh my god...that's me in the middle. Seriously have you ever seen a better shop display.  http://twitpic.com/1zbg1
jimmycarr,in a weird shop. Having orthotics fitted to my incredibly flat feet. My last Dr told me they were the worst he'd ever seen - nice of him.
jimmycarr,"Hello to you, very exciting news about our Em. I can't believe Frank Skinners luck. I imagin David B is thrilled for her."
jimmycarr,@ferretprincess just to clarify Emily Dean is one of the producers of the 'big fat quiz of the year'. @divine_miss_em if you want a twitter
jimmycarr,@sazzy69 the details of the new frank skinner radio show are on chortle.co.uk which is a great website if you're into comedy.
jimmycarr,@gembo81 i don't know if history does repeat itself. maybe you just had a boring history teacher and it all just sounded the same.
jimmycarr,just seen that frank skinner has a new radio show and he's presenting it with one of my best friends emily dean- she's very funny. good news
jimmycarr,"weirdly the news this morning is a 're-run' from the mid 70's. its all about recession and IRA shootings. it takes you back. hang on, shit.."
jimmycarr,@pauldavidjones exactly the kind of thinking we needs. Good work
jimmycarr,i'm finding twittering very relaxing. just got back from doing a preview show of the next tour. it needs alot of work but i've got till aug.
jimmycarr,@SamJaye joke technican is the name of the tour i'm on. i wrote a book (with lucy greeves) called the naked jape. thats that cleared up.
jimmycarr,@Jin68 reverse inventing is purely a twitter thing. i think its a funny idea but i like the fact its not just me writing them.
jimmycarr,@ben_wiebe this is just getting better and better. an invention that allows everyone to have bottled water 'on tap'. i love it.
jimmycarr,@katiemcconway its a great idea. proper old fashioned stalking where instead of posting messages i get scared and you murder me. cool.
jimmycarr,@livinglifewales i love it.
jimmycarr,@GangstaBennie quality reference to the classic joke 'what's the most difficult thing about rollerblading? telling your parents you're gay.
jimmycarr,@manutdot top quality reverse inventing.
jimmycarr,www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDDHHrt6l4w if anything this is better than the Watchmen film. just a warning its a bit hardcore so not for kids.
jimmycarr,@MissBox very good idea but what if one of these 'motionless escalators' broke down. People would be stuck forever.
jimmycarr,@SimplyPaul well Adam & Joe are very funny boys. Always one step ahead.
jimmycarr,@_Jennings_ that's a capital idea. A home iPod system. Love it.
jimmycarr,@chubbyewok quality 'reverse inventing'. A solid brick tent.
jimmycarr,i think i might have to do a 'twitter' version of dragons den with all your 'reverse inventions'. i might put together a top 10.
jimmycarr,@jeanetteseddon i'm interested in developing a remote control that's actually integrated into the t.v. So the buttons are on your televison
jimmycarr,what about if contact lenses were massive. really really big. too big to go in your eyes. you'd have to sort of wear them on your face.
jimmycarr,i've had an idea for Roller skates but you somehow take the wheels off and you 'walk' in them.
jimmycarr,"@GoodOlGled no, I save the jokes for my shows.  I'm tweeting idle thoughts & observations, things people can join in on. I'm loving it."
jimmycarr,@Maninahat i once bought a 330ml bottle of water that proudly proclaimed on the label 'now portable'.
jimmycarr,@john_self thats pretty funny. although i really miss woolworths. i got quite emotional filling a christmas stocking there last year.
jimmycarr,@westeross yeah all gifts are free. good point well made.
jimmycarr,i once heard a senior police officer interviewed about the new 'crime reduction initiative'. isn't that just the day job.
jimmycarr,begs the question what is the most redundant thing printed on the front of a magazine. i saw a Vogue 'fashion special' once. any thoughts?
jimmycarr,Lost the tennis today but a joy to play outdoors - I've just spotted 'mens health' have done a ' fitness special'. As aposed to?
jimmycarr,Huge lunch of salmon and beef now off to play tennis. Probably should have done that in the reverse order.
jimmycarr,my new tour starts in august & i'm trying to get the material together. thats the 'work' i'm doing. i need about 300 jokes for a show. shit.
jimmycarr,right monday morning. i should really do some work but there's twittering to get on with. and its not like i do 'real' work anyway.
jimmycarr,back to the safety of north london. looking forward to tennis & lunch tomorrow and then a preview show of new material for next years tour
jimmycarr,nice theatre & I love gigs on Sundays. full of people determined to get every last drop of fun out of the weekend.  http://twitpic.com/1xrkj
jimmycarr,If backstage in Milton Keynes gets any more depressing I'm calling Amnesty International.  http://twitpic.com/1xrgc
jimmycarr,Backstage in Milton Keynes has an 'open prison' feel.  http://twitpic.com/1xr9d
jimmycarr,I'm guessing the reason for all the round abouts in Milton Keynes is to give visitors plenty of chances to turn back.
jimmycarr,Is 'international women's day' just a bigger version of 'ladies night'?
jimmycarr,Did anyone else see that David Baddial column in esquire about how 'love' has replaced 'god' in our art and culture. Brilliant observation.
jimmycarr,Is it wrong with all the troubles in the world that I read the tv listings magazine first this morning?
jimmycarr,"I don't have an imaginary friend, so no church. But I do miss the sing song on Sunday mornings. Steve Wrights love songs will have to do."
jimmycarr,@justcallmeslow I love it. All the shops in a shopping mall spread out into 'Streets'. What if instead of 'out of town' they were 'in town'
jimmycarr,just checked the best way to get to milton keynes on my iphone and its advised me its a 1 day and 20 hour walk - i think i might drive.
jimmycarr,@softwethands oh my god you've made me feel old. i actually remember friends of mine that had 'payphones' in their hallways.
jimmycarr,what if instead of texting there was a way of 'talking' to people on mobile phones. but the phones were attached to the wall in a hallway.
jimmycarr,heading off to milton keynes tomorrow and looking forward to it. the shopping mall there is enormous. its like they put a roof on croydon.
jimmycarr,@denniscaswell no a friend of mine has done all my tour poster the last 8 years. having said that i'm a huge fan of Julian Opie - very cool.
jimmycarr,@rhysjonesy putting internet porn in mags is a great idea. but how would we distribute the material? I have it! leave them in wood land.
jimmycarr,@rambo3647 love the idea of doing a 'simpsons movie' tv show.
jimmycarr,i'm so impressed with Chris Moyles climbing Killimanjaro. or Killimanjaro climbing Chris Moyles. which ever way you look at it its amazing.
jimmycarr,@_Jennings_ you've made it even worse and it was bad already. so well done you.
jimmycarr,i've got a friend that has what looks like fish fingers everyday. i think he was in a fire.
jimmycarr,@clovergihrl  i'm still loving the reverse inventing. keep that up. i don't know why but it really makes me laugh.
jimmycarr,@SarahSaner yeah its me. just having a little twitter before the gig in Preston. & really enjoying all the feedback.
jimmycarr,@tumour how's that not a great thing? i love 'shaun of the dead'. i bet James end up doing a Simon Pegg and makes it in hollywood.
jimmycarr,just watched James Cordon on Jonathan's show. His sketch show looks really good. i find James laugh so infectious - it just makes me laugh.
jimmycarr,for some reason the gigs in Preston start at 7.45pm very odd. had very posh fish fingers for lunch. you forget how delicious they are.
jimmycarr,Who buys a 'bush shaper' for their mum on mothers day?  http://twitpic.com/1wimr
jimmycarr,spotted this. A device for shapping a womans 'special lady garden'. The next tweet will show you why I laughed.  http://twitpic.com/1wiip
jimmycarr,"View from my room this morning. A cold, crisp Manchester day - perfect.  http://twitpic.com/1wgv4"
jimmycarr,back in manchester. just had decaf coffee in the hotel bar with @justinmoorhouse - we put the world to rights. off to watch QI before bed.
jimmycarr,"The venue is pretty nice. But Preston is a mans town, I've never felt so soft and southern.  http://twitpic.com/1vusp"
jimmycarr,backstage in Preston.  http://twitpic.com/1vulh
jimmycarr,Backstage in Preston. It has a 'retro futurist' feel to it. I'll post a photo later.   Just had a little chocolate for energy.
jimmycarr,Just got talking to a woman who said 'manchesters china town is better than londons china town'. I said you should see the one in Hong Kong
jimmycarr,The more I read about The 'Great' Depression the less good it sounds. Bloody government spin.
jimmycarr,Thoughts whilst eating; crispy seaweed is basically 'deep fried salad'   it's both delicious and paradoxical.
jimmycarr,In a Chinese restaurant in manchester. Yang Sing recommended by Justin Moorehouse no less. Think I might do some work while I eat.
jimmycarr,Well I was always going to love a movie where one of the main characters is called 'the comedian'. I loved it.
jimmycarr,The economy is offically on it's arse. 11am showing is packed. Star trek trailer is pretty cool. I think I'm a geek. Damn it.
jimmycarr,"In starbucks getting caffinated. I don't regulate my caffine intake by cups, I have a target heart rate. Venti it is."
jimmycarr,of to preston tonight. should be fun. but before that 'watchmen'. very excited. a full 140 word review should be available in about 3 hours.
jimmycarr,Just watching 'natures great events' it's stunningly beautiful. But when are they going to make a natural history program about unicorns?
jimmycarr,manchester rules. i've been coming here regularly for the past 10 years and its just transformed. its such a great place to spend a day.
jimmycarr,just got into manchester. i won't make the midnight showing on watchmen. 11am imax it is.
jimmycarr,just walked off stage - it was the end of the gig i wasn't having a hissy fit. quick signing then driving to manchester. i bloody love it.
jimmycarr,@dopeydee i just laughed. i don't always have to win. when someone heckles something funny i just enjoy it. makes my life easy.
jimmycarr,I didn't hear what someone said at the back. I pointed up and said 'what's that?' Someone else said 'a balcony'. Maybe you had to be there.
jimmycarr,"nice to hear from USA. we threw the war of independence btw. could have taken you. right, off to work, Halifax isn't going to amuse itself."
jimmycarr,"@DesmoidSurvivor well yes, comedy central presents me is on tomorrow night. i haven't seen the edit so let me know if its any good."
jimmycarr,is anyone following my twittering in America?
jimmycarr,@chad0 very funny indeed. big up.
jimmycarr,@AndyGillooley a book of the passion of the christ is a great idea. i didn't like the 'hollywood ending' where the guy comes back -
jimmycarr,just realized if you didn't read the 'reverse inventing' twitters yesterday you now think i'm mentally sub normal.
jimmycarr,just been on google and someone called alan moore has stolen my idea and he's managed to go back in time. bastard!
jimmycarr,i've had an idea for doing the watchman movie but in book form. you just draw loads of the best scenes with dialogue written on them.
jimmycarr,watchmen is on in manchester at 12.01 tonight. i think i might go. i'm so excited. i feel 14 years old.
jimmycarr,i'm downloading 'nature's great events' to my desktop. its telling me it'll be ready in 39.30 hours. is that some kind of record?
jimmycarr,Halifax venue for tonights show. Beautiful room and good people. Photo by trusty tour manager Gav.  http://twitpic.com/1v6gc
jimmycarr,Backstage in Halifax. Having a twitter. I ask myself 'will the glamour ever start.' http://twitpic.com/1v5pa
jimmycarr,Tunbridge wells venue yesterday. People did arrive later. Honestly.  http://twitpic.com/1v5g4
jimmycarr,Very funny replies. Well done you. I've just had the best fajitas in Halifax. Actually they were great. Can't believe my luck.
jimmycarr,do you think if Jesus was alive today his friends would call him jay-z or J Dog?
jimmycarr,The restaurant has a sign up saying 'today's special'. Quite right carpe dium.
jimmycarr,I loving your replies twitterers. The born again Christian was a little phased. He was American and he didn't appear to get the jay-z ref.
jimmycarr,in 'ricci & Capone's'. It says it does 'the best Italian american dishes in town'. What? The best in all of Halifax. We'll see.
jimmycarr,Just arrived in Halifax. Off for a wander round. Beware born agains.
jimmycarr,yesterday a born again Christian stopped me and asked what was the most important thing in my life. My reply 'money over bitches'. Wrong?
jimmycarr,Just learning how to post photos. Check out my hat on Jonathans twitted.
jimmycarr,Just played. 6/1 7/6 6/7. But I lost the last set so does that mean Ross won? Brunch then driving to Halifax.
jimmycarr,off to play tennis. My god it's cold. But luckily heat seats. Aaahhh heat seats.
jimmycarr,I'm watching FM on itv2. I really like it. Reminds me of my days at xfm.
jimmycarr,tunbridge wales surprisingly up for it on a wednesday night. can't believe my luck. off to do a signing post gig. always nice to say hello.
jimmycarr,just about to walk on stage. 8pm on the dot. well done tunbridge wells. good time keeping.
jimmycarr,they're just editing the 2nd series of the inbetweeners. lot of the stories in it are things that actually happened to iain - tragic really
jimmycarr,"wait no, my mistake its like a prison camp. all painted an institutional yellow. still, looking forward to the show."
jimmycarr,backstage at the tunbridge wells Assembly Hall is AMAZING! i can't move for cocaine and hookers. i really am knee deep in hookers and gin.
jimmycarr,glad some people remember my show with iain on xfm. i really enjoyed my stint on local radio. iain now writes the inbetweeners. so big up.
jimmycarr,not planning on touring america - its massive. but i'm on comedy central with a new special this friday if thats a help.
jimmycarr,i did a show called 'charm offensive' which was a good name for the show. i like 'joke technican' makes it sound like a real job.
jimmycarr,just looking over tour dates for autumn. just wanted to check what do the twitterers think of the show title 'rapier wit'.
jimmycarr,i can't get over the guys i met today. a soldier asked me if it was scary being on stage? not as scary as being blown up i wouldn't imagine.
jimmycarr,apparently my twitters appear magically on 'facebook' where they've caused some concern. i shall learn to post photos to show its really me.
jimmycarr,Happy to report it was the sprig of mint that made the sorbet.
jimmycarr,It's raining now. Think that might be a good enough excuse to order dessert. The Mango & lychee sorbet better have lime zest.
jimmycarr,In wagamama in tunbridge well. I couldn't be more middle class.
jimmycarr,I managed to avoid doing a prince Philip and saying something fuckwitted.
jimmycarr,Correction. Not 'ex-servicemen' servicemen. They're still in the forces just injured.
jimmycarr,just spent a few hours at headley court hanging around with injured ex-servicemen. A very humbling experience.
jimmycarr,My car has been the victim of a pigeon 'dirty protest'. It's reminded me of Hunger. I'm giving in to their demands.
jimmycarr,just getting in the car. quick stop for a pint of coffee on the way i think. i'm not addicted i just get angry and sad if i dont get my fix.
jimmycarr,just up. off to this military hospital today. really excited about it. my iphone maps has just told me how long it'll take to walk there.
jimmycarr,i'm off to bed. might try and put some pictures on twitter tomorrow. it'll be the future by then. night night cyber people.
jimmycarr,good point. i'm sure they'll be able to handle the odd joke. and if they don't find me funny they can always kill me with their bare hands.
jimmycarr,off to headley court tomorrow to hang out with ex service men that have been injured. i'm slightly worried about saying the wrong thing.
jimmycarr,Fergy1000 has a much better definition than me. it pretty much nails modern media. big up fergy1000
jimmycarr,little factoid about factoids there.
jimmycarr,that's not a fact just a 'factoid'. a phrase coined by norman mailer to describe information that everyone knows but which may not be true.
jimmycarr,the reason we have 'public information films' ('charlie says' & stroke ads) is because they never cut the propaganda budget after the war.
jimmycarr,"just relaxing at home. had a bath, currently wearing a palmarosa face mask. could that stroke advert be any more terrifying?"
jimmycarr,Just spotted danny Wallace. When he was writing 'yes man' do you think he was careful not to walk home threw the park? I'll ask.
jimmycarr,in the groucho. Doing meeja business. Does that make me a bad person or merely cliched?
jimmycarr,"i've just seen loads of midgets coming out of a building, all wearing the same thing...hang on they're children."
jimmycarr,A nice lady from lancashire on the tube has just asked me 'do you know who you are?'
jimmycarr,Just had my ears cleaned out by my ENT guy Dr Waring. It was so satisfying almost spiritual.
jimmycarr,Was fanta invented by the Nazis? It's such an apealing story I don't want to know it's a lie.
jimmycarr,Someones just said 'everyones fond of owls'. A bird with a cats head. Deeply suspicious.
jimmycarr,in giraffe for lunch. There's a time and a place for world music and it's not here and now.
jimmycarr,loving jo_parry and her mental idea for 'plays'. like tv shows but without cameras. can't see it working but we need keen minds like hers.
jimmycarr,"i'm really enjoying 'reverse inventing' today. its so much easier than traditional inventing, where you come up with something new."
jimmycarr,'books' is interesting...you mean like a project to get all the stuff on the internet and write it down on paper. i suppose it could work.
jimmycarr,you know satnav? i've just come up with a way of printing it out into a large format book. you could keep it in the car. i call it 'maps'.
jimmycarr,Meeting with iTunes today. I'm gonna pitch them a data storage solution I've been developing - vynal disk.
jimmycarr,I'm having pizza and granola for breakfast. It's a bit like a big mac and a diet coke.
jimmycarr,right off to bed. i'm guessing twitter shuts down at midnight anyway - like proper telly used to in the 80's. night night cyber girls & boys
jimmycarr,just remembered the proudest moments of my life. taking a whole mexican meal into a cinema in manchester. breaking the rules taste good.
jimmycarr,is it wrong to bring your own sweets to the cinema? i'm doing ok but 3.50 for maltesers is taking the piss.
jimmycarr,is that toby young? i've not figured out how to reply directly. it would appear the future started without me. this is really rather fun.
jimmycarr,popcorn advice; at the cinema get them to do a mix of half salt half sweet - trust me.
jimmycarr,just watched Billy Connolly travel in canada. he's like a rock n roll michael Palin. is that what all comics end up doing? christmas future?
jimmycarr,i'm not just in touch with my feminine side - i've got my own pretty little boobies.
jimmycarr,just got some QI dates threw today. its a fun show to do. but its filled my head with half remembered facts. its a a glimpse into senility.
jimmycarr,its not a ladies tennis bag - its just got a pink trim.
jimmycarr,i don't actually take tennis that seriously..... I'm currently number 4 in Britain.
jimmycarr,i'm having a night off and i've got the weird feeling i get when it gets to this time in the evening and i haven't told any jokes.
jimmycarr,Just got back from Belfast and Derry (not Londonderry or they go mental). Ate in the same restaurant 3 days in a row. Am I mental?
jimmycarr,Second half of the pretzels now gone. They're like a delicous version of crack cocaine.
jimmycarr,I've just got back from playing jonathan Ross. And proptly eaten half a pack of chocolate covered pretzels.
