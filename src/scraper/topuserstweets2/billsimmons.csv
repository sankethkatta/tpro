billsimmons,"Congrats Giants fans. On a personal note, this Red Sox fan is delighted the 2012 baseball season is over. Go away baseball."
billsimmons,"Wow, if we had the ""defense can score on the 2-point conversion"" rule (which we should), Carolina would have just had a go-ahead ""pick-two."""
billsimmons,Is this Andy Reid's last game? I can't decide if the Eagles are quitting on him or if they just suck. Maybe it's both.
billsimmons,"Instead of painting Harden as greedy, OKC should just admit they didn't think he was a max guy + wanted those Houston assets + flexibility."
billsimmons,"OKC has everyone thinking they're a mom &amp; pop store, meanwhile they made 30-35 million profit last year + could sell team for $550m easy."
billsimmons,PS: We had a lockout + missed 16 games because NBA teams twist the truth about how much money they're making (and continue to do so).
billsimmons,"FYI: Harden did not ""leave"" OKC. They offered him less than his market value, he said no, they abruptly traded him. That's what happened."
billsimmons,Bigger point: OKC wanted Harden to take  less $$$$ when he had no guarantee OKC wouldn't shop him some day (like what Boston did to Rondo).
billsimmons,I already have an answer! Apparently you can only get a no-trade clause after 8 years in NBA (and has to be 4 with the same team).
billsimmons,"If OKC wanted Harden to take less (and I heard it was $53m, not $56) to stay, then why not offer him a no-trade clause? Loyalty goes 2 ways."
billsimmons,"PS: OKC could have kept Harden, made a title run and re-evaluated next summer - THEY were the ones that lowballed him, then traded him."
billsimmons,PS: Harden didn't ask for a trade. He just turned down a subpar offer from a team crying poverty that made 30-35 million PROFIT last season.
billsimmons,I fully support Harden refusing to take 4 yrs 52-54m from OKC. Could get 5 years 75-80m from Houston (no state tax). It's no contest.

billsimmons,"Tremendous sporting event. Spain really made USA work for that one. CP KD Kobe LBj Love did a collective ""I got this"" in 4th. Especially CP."

billsimmons,If you have Facebook and want in on this MJ or Magic greatest playoff game debate between me and @WhitlockJason ... https://t.co/RrqmhPtP
billsimmons,"@WhitlockJason Wasn't a must-win though. If they lost, Game 7 was in LA + Kareem was playing. Bulls had to win title in Utah. Higher stakes."
billsimmons,@WhitlockJason Wilkes had 37 and outplayed Doc. Magic had major help. And you could have guarded Darryl Dawkins. MJ in 98 = 1 on 5.
billsimmons,@WhitlockJason MJ played 103 of 103 games that year. 4153 mins. Totally worn down. Beat Jazz by himself. Bulls had 22 total Rebs that game.
billsimmons,"@WhitlockJason 35 years old, playing in his 304th game in past 32 mths."
billsimmons,I'd be surprised if he came back. He can get one more good FA contract plus Celts have Bradley. RT @NateDavis979: What about Ray next year?
billsimmons,"@WhitlockJason MJ's last Bulls game is the greatest modern playoff performance. Pippen was hurt, Rodman was done. 1 vs 5 on road and he won."
billsimmons,"For the record - even if the Celts lose tonight, I'd bet anything that KG, Pierce &amp; Rondo are in Boston next season."
billsimmons,"It's our 1-year anniversary at @Grantland33 today. Couldn't be happier about heading into year 2 with our current team, it's been a blast."

billsimmons,@johnhollinger Pippen was bigger than Pierce and jumped higher too... averaged 3 fouls per game in playoffs. Doing all same things as LBJ.
billsimmons,"PS: Shame of Game 2 is that I'll remember the refs as much as Rondo going all 53 in 1 of the greatest Celtic performances ever. Thanks, NBA."
billsimmons,"Last point: it's not about favoring teams, but favoring STARS. That's what the NBA does. My '06 column still holds: http://t.co/Mv0dbXLC"
billsimmons,"Last night's shot chart negates any ""Miami takes it to the hoop more"" argument. http://t.co/FSkb3vkO Oh and Miami took 11 more 3's."
billsimmons,"PS: The irony is that LBJ, Wade and Battier are 3 of the league's most aggressive players. They were given carte blanche last night. Fact."
billsimmons,Last night's officiating travesty wasn't just about the 2 missed calls in OT. LBJ/Battier/Wade were reffed differently than Pierce. Period.
billsimmons,"Even MJ never averaged less than 2 fouls per game in the playoffs. Here, look. http://t.co/UglWrms1"
billsimmons,"In playoffs: LBJ ranks 2nd in MPG (41.1), 1st in FTA (10.8), 15th in RPG (9.2), 4th in steals (2.2) ... and 104th in fouls per game (1.8)."
billsimmons,My column that posted late-yesterday: Retro-diary of OKC-SA Game 2 (coupled with an appreciation of the Spurs). http://t.co/3XN7xCHD
billsimmons,You can't win 5 against 8. This game is one of the all-time jokes. I am so disgusted by this game and the league as a whole.
billsimmons,Just so you know: every Celtics fan wanted LBJ to shoot that off balance jumper instead of talking Rondo to the rim. So thanks LeBron.
billsimmons,I can't take it. I might ask my family to stay in a hotel tonight just to be safe.
billsimmons,"27 fouls for Boston, 16 for Miami. 3x as many fouls for PP as LBJ and Wade combined. Oh, and New Orleans won the lottery tonight."
billsimmons,Really hope I'm not going to be thinking about Ray missing that wide-open 3 up five with 3 mins to go all summer.
billsimmons,Does any future Hall of Famer get into foul trouble more than Pierce? Meanwhile LBJ + Wade have 2 fouls combined. (I'm in full homer mode.)
billsimmons,"I'm amending that last tweet - Rondo looks gassed. Hard to tell how much he has left in the tank but I think it's close to ""E."" What a game!"
billsimmons,Such a Rondonian game. It's like the 1st half never happened. Why did he stop going to the hoop? Can't remember rooting for a bigger enigma.
billsimmons,"Brutal quarter - I think Ray gave his dead legs to KG. Too many 2nd chances for Miami. Celts gave this game away, Mia was asleep 1st half."
billsimmons,Fascinating Rondo performance. I think he's playing the full 48. Clearly pacing himself in this quarter. I like it. C's needed to roll dice.
billsimmons,"Surprised nobody on ESPN made a bigger deal that Rondo went all 24 mins in the first half. Monster effort by Rondo, big gamble by Doc."
billsimmons,"So happy the NBA gave me a lifetime of new conspiracy jokes. Move over MJ/gambling + Ewing/frozen envelope, there's a new sheriff in town!"
billsimmons,"So great. So so so so so great. I love the WWE. Er, the NBA."
billsimmons,Now that's comedy...
billsimmons,Of the 3 remaining - I hope the 'Brow ends up in DC. Most fun team remaining by far. Worst-case scenario by far: that crap Charlotte team.

billsimmons,This Spurs team is really something. A healthy CP/Blake wouldn't have changed much. Clips need to spend summer figuring out coach + best 8.
billsimmons,"If this were boxing, the ref would have stopped the Popovich-Del Negro fight 4 rounds ago."
billsimmons,Kawhi Leonard was absolutely terrific in this game. That's the best random trade for both teams in awhile - Kawhi for George Hill.
billsimmons,Clips season resting on Eric Bledsoe's shoulders right now. He has to spark the team and crowd right now.
billsimmons,"I'm at this game--Spurs down 15 but whole team is locked in including bench, have that collective ""F these guys we can win this"" vibe going."
billsimmons,Interesting subplot if Clips keep lead in the 20's - at what point in 2nd half does Popp pack it in because they're playing again tomorrow?

billsimmons,RT @canyonjim: I think the final step of Buddhism might involve forgiving the refs who worked tonight's Clipper game.
billsimmons,Grizz did a great job late - executed with backs to wall. Clips did the opposite. Not a stellar 4th Q for Vinny + CP.

billsimmons,Clips at their best when they're small but that means Young or Foye/Williams on Gay. Have to play odds + hope he doesn't torch them.
billsimmons,Rudy Gay era taking a big hit in this Clips series. Starting to wonder if ZBo-Gasol-TA-OJ-Conley is Mem's best playoff lineup (ala 2011).
billsimmons,Particularly terrible refs for this clips-grizz game. No control on either end. Over-under for techs has to be like 4.5. I take the over.
billsimmons,1st Clipper home playoff game in 6 solid years. I am expecting one of Donald Sterling's oiliest performances ever.

billsimmons,"The Red Sox need to trade for a ""Crazy Guy Who Escalates the Bench-Clearing Brawl"" guy. Papelbon just isn't getting it done in these fights."
billsimmons,"Damn, Big Papi just missed a left hook. Put it this way: we didn't have to dust off HBO's Punchstat guys for that one."

billsimmons,Second-biggest flaw in Victory: entire crowd escaping without anyone getting shot by Germans. Pretty sure that wouldn't have happened.
billsimmons,Biggest flaw in Victory coming up: Sly catching the final penalty kick. They pushed it one leap of faith too far. Should've just tipped it.
billsimmons,"Max Von Sydow's credit for Victory should have just said ""The Good Nazi."" I love when he cheers Pele's bicycle kick, that's a great moment."
billsimmons,One of my fav parts of Victory is how they cut it so that Michael Caine NEVER has a soccer scene. You just see him jogging at half speed.
