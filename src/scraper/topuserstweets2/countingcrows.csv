countingcrows,@BitTorrent They encouraged and got great feedback from all the fans and other entrants. People were very supportive of each other #crowchat
countingcrows,"@BitTorrent It was on IndabaMusic. And other than the slight screwup at the end, they have a cool way of making people part of it #crowchat"
countingcrows,@BitTorrent Just an announcer interrupted by 30min of screaming &amp; a tiny band in the background. Guess Beatles shows were wild #crowchat
countingcrows,"@BitTorrent My first bootleg was a vinyl Beatles concert. Sounded like this: ""Ladies &amp; Gentlemen! Introducing -- AAAAAAAHHHHHH!!"" #crowchat"
countingcrows,"@BitTorrent Strangely (or as per usual), our fans &amp; I disagreed completely on the best ones. All my faves were below 150th place #crowchat"
countingcrows,@BitTorrent It's just a subjective opinion. I would've been ok with the 18. They were all great. I was impressed. #crowchat
countingcrows,@BitTorrent I really don't like picking things like that. People invest a lot &amp; I don't think I should say 1 is better than others #crowchat
countingcrows,"@BitTorrent I eventually chose 18, then 6 winners. They misquoted me and made 3 winners and 3 runners-up but that was wrong. #crowchat"
countingcrows,@BitTorrent I don't know what to say. Is there a question? There were too many good covers in the end. I didn't like deciding #crowchat

countingcrows,@BitTorrent @Rickylive It's easy to get to the Brooklyn gig. It's a few blks from the Bedford L stop. It's the 1st stop in Brklyn #crowchat
countingcrows,"@BitTorrent Hopefully it looks a lot like a boat on fire w/rats jumping out all the portholes. We can dream, can't we? #crowchat"
countingcrows,@BitTorrent @SFMusicTech I think October is a long way off &amp; I don't think you really want me speaking at that. #crowchat
countingcrows,"@onthewireagain @BitTorrent And, obviously, the BitTorrent sites could choose to police themselves but they won't. Humans (sigh) #crowchat"
countingcrows,@onthewireagain @BitTorrent Maybe. Bur nothing will really stop illegal torrenting except a decision by y'all not to do it. #crowchat
countingcrows,@BitTorrent @AndrewPacheco13 More. #crowchat
countingcrows,@BitTorrent @Rickylive I really think the NY Subway system is one of the greatest things about this city. Anywhere u wanna go 24/7 #crowchat
countingcrows,@BitTorrent I wrote a ton last year but it all went into the play. I didn't stop writing. I just didn't write for CC. #crowchat
countingcrows,@Rickylive @Bittorrent Can I just point out to everyone complaining about no NYC dates that Brooklyn is in NYC. Get a subway map #crowchat
countingcrows,@onthewireagain @BitTorrent Thanks Matthew #crowchat
countingcrows,"@BitTorrent I'm a really nice guy. Also, I'm so miserable that it'd be impossible to be jealous of me. Voila! No band jealousy. #crowchat"
countingcrows,"@onthewireagain @BitTorrent Nobody owes u free music. We choose to give it to u. If u don't support bands, there won't be any #crowchat"
countingcrows,"@onthewireagain @BitTorrent It's important, in all this excitement, that people don't abdicate their responsibilities as well #crowchat"
countingcrows,"@onthewireagain @BitTorrent No, if people love it AND people pay for it, then the $ follows. Then the bands can survive  #crowchat"
countingcrows,"@BitTorrent It exists. The only artists on T-Recs are us and @NOTARNYC , whose album is freaking amazing. #crowchat"
countingcrows,@filligar @onthewireagain @bittorrent Really cool gift from Filligar. Their awesome record for free! Go get it. #crowchat
countingcrows,RT @filligar: @onthewireagain @countingcrows @bittorrent Here's a free download of our record http://t.co/N5NpiuKU #outlawroadshow #crowchat
countingcrows,@BitTorrent @AndrewPacheco13 All the songs in the world that we didn't record.  #crowchat
countingcrows,@BitTorrent It's like all songs. It means what it says. I don't know.
countingcrows,"@BitTorrent ""All My Failures"" is Taylor's song, not mine. I suppose it's about fucking up."
countingcrows,@onthewireagain @BitTorrent No. This is all about money too. No joke. Grownups go to work to earn $. It's life. We're no different #crowchat
countingcrows,"@AndrewPacheco13 @BitTorrent That said, I'm pretty available in other forums now that weren't available back then #crowchat"
countingcrows,@BitTorrent @AndrewPacheco13 I want the message boards back up too. They're how we all first connected. I'll look into it. #crowchat
countingcrows,"@BitTorrent There a billion we didn't get around to. Didn't finish ""Local Boy In A Photograph""-Stereophonics #crowchat"
countingcrows,"@onthewireagain @bittorrent Speaking of, @daytrotter just put up Roadshow band @_FieldReport. It's amazing http://t.co/O0JArden #crowchat"
countingcrows,"@BitTorrent @MauriceGoodwin2 No. Not really. I mean, everything you do affects everything else so I'm sure they did something #crowchat"
countingcrows,@BitTorrent Maybe you're right. I just looked and I don't see a Message Board either. Maybe they renamed it. Hmmm... #crowchat
countingcrows,"@BitTorrent All acts get picked the same way, if not allays for the same reason. We pick them. #crowchat"
countingcrows,"@BitTorrent As far as I know, the message boards are still there. Have you been drinking in the daytime again? #crowchat"
countingcrows,@onthewireagain @bittorrent Also @theromanyrye @MeanCreek
countingcrows,@onthewireagain @bittorrent All the roadshow bands this summer are great. @WeAreAugustines @KaseyAnderson @_FieldReport #crowchat
countingcrows,@onthewireagain @bittorrent All the bands of The Outlaw roadshow this summer are great. @filligar @GoodOldWar @foreignfields #crowchat
countingcrows,"@BitTorrent That said, we may still do some. Letterman, GMA, others have all made offers. #crowchat"
countingcrows,"@BitTorrent We're an independent band now. Want to cement relationships build a network in the future, not the past #crowchat"
countingcrows,@BitTorrent I made a decision to stay away from all the mainstream stuff at first and concentrate mostly on the bloggers #crowchat
countingcrows,@BitTorrent What's the point in thinking about changing a life you already lived? I had my chances. I screwed up lots. I'll live. #crowchat
countingcrows,"@BitTorrent I'd play Top of the Pops that 1st time. I was uncomfortable but it's their nat'l show. Other than that, I dunno... #crowchat"
countingcrows,@BitTorrent Is anybody out there? #crowchat
countingcrows,@BitTorrent Depends how my voice is holding up. I'm often a monk in hotel rooms on the road so my voice holds up. Can't risk gigs #crowchat
countingcrows,@BitTorrent We have been talking about putting together a really cool deluxe version of Recovering The Satellites.
countingcrows,"@BitTorrent Hey Bryon, how are u? As far as I know everything WAS out on vinyl. No plans for that. They're Universal's records #crowchat"
countingcrows,@BitTorrent Margery just wasn't good enough. It's that simple. We never recorded a version that warranted making it on a record #crowchat
countingcrows,@BitTorrent @twitlonger ok
countingcrows,@BitTorrent The best way to get an autograph if you really need one is to run up screaming in a library or public toilet.  #crowchat
countingcrows,"@BitTorrent Honestly, most people just talk to me like a normal guy, which is sorta what I am #crowchat"
countingcrows,@BitTorrent I like how normal my life is in NYC and Berkeley. People just treat me like a person. #crowchat
countingcrows,@BitTorrent I rarely go for hidden meanings. I'm not writing riddles. Mr. Jones is not my dick. He's a guy named Martin Jones #crowchat
countingcrows,"@BitTorrent No Stephen, it's just a line from a movie called Signs of Life. #crowchat"
countingcrows,@BitTorrent Knowing personal stuff about me isn't a problem. Running up needing photos/autographs.etc... like it's a freakshow is #crowchat
countingcrows,@BitTorrent I don't know that it is. People here in New York treat me pretty normal.  #crowchat
countingcrows,@BitTorrent @Jaleman1991asks @indiequick Yes. And now I'm declaring a ceasefire on all semi-clever lyric based cutesy questiions  #crowchat
countingcrows,"@BitTorrent @Jaleman1991asks If that worked, me &amp; my exes'd get back together every week #crowchat"
countingcrows,@BitTorrent @Jaleman1991asks Don't you think it'd be better if you got back together for some other reason.  #crowchat
countingcrows,@BitTorrent @dianed09 @josefinnygren89 @mitchellyoung19 @ChrisMcTravel (sigh) Perhaps. #crowchat
countingcrows,"@BitTorrent @Goddess_Rae We pretty much tell y'all when we know what we're doing. If I haven't said, it's cuz I don't know yet #crowchat"
countingcrows,"@BitTorrent @Goddess_Rae This is the first in a series of ""I dunno"" answers. Still working on the 3rd leg of THE OUTLAW ROADSHOW #crowchat"
countingcrows,@BitTorrent @fastfreddy623 I think this record's probably better on CD. #crowchat
countingcrows,@BitTorrent @fastfreddy623 It's out on vinyl. Weird. People keep asking that but the record is out on vinyl. Maybe just in stores #crowchat
countingcrows,@BitTorrent @onthewireagain I just always thought a bad day when u wrote a song was better than one where you didn't. #crowchat
countingcrows,@BitTorrent @onthewireagain Neither really. It doesn't solve anything writing songs. Always thought a bad day when u wrote #crowchat
countingcrows,@BitTorrent @zapiekanki Bands end. It happens. #crowchat
countingcrows,"@BitTorrent @zapiekanki I grew up a huge fan. I loved REM. That said, everybody's gotta do what they gotta do. It's their call. #crowchat"
countingcrows,@BitTorrent @Shawna74 I dunno. Freeloaders will probably come out this summer. I have enough on my plate w/the band &amp; the play #crowchat
countingcrows,@BitTorrent @Shawna74 (shrug) I don't know. Freeloaders will probably come out this summer. I have enough on my plate w/the band &amp; the play.
countingcrows,@BitTorrent @Brooneyedgal The truth is there are so many great songs out there that we would never run out of inspiration #crowchat
countingcrows,@BitTorrent @Brooneyedgal I always envisioned this as an endless record to be added to whenever we recorded another cover. #crowchat
countingcrows,@BitTorrent Let me rephrase that: Sure #crowchat

countingcrows,@Trakenn The casino had curfews and time limits on us. Mean Creek dropped from 45 to 30 &amp; we got clipped from 2hrs to 90min.
countingcrows,@gentlemenhall It's going really well. How's life? Your set was ridiculously good in Austin. Thanks for being there.
countingcrows,"""Rosemary &amp; Rue"" seems like it's a fantasy novel but it's really a Raymond Chandler book in disguise."
countingcrows,"""Chasing The Jersey""-the story of 1 girl's attempt to find happiness by fucking America's jocks right out of their straps. Tragically funny."
countingcrows,"Halfway through @StefWilliams25 's book ""Chasing The Jersey"" now. I found her outrageous and insanely wrong but very funny blog here."
countingcrows,"Found books to read too. I saw on Twitter that @seananmcguire was a CC fan and I read her book ""Rosemary &amp; Rue"" after that. Fun. I dug it."

crack in the wall of her bedroom"""

countingcrows,There are a lot of people with beautiful voices on @indabamusicapi but sometimes they lose the thread of the song while being pretty.
countingcrows,"By ""consistency of tone"", I don't mean anything technical; I mean pure FOCUS - feeling/delivering the whole song w/o obvious ""performing"""
countingcrows,"As I go thru all the @indabamusicapi contest entries, I notice the hardest thing by far for most people is to maintain a consistency of tone"
countingcrows,"@ChrisCookTTU @rachelleahs You 2 stop fighting or I'll pull over. Chris, I still would've been nice-I'm a fan too. Rachel, I'm always nice."

countingcrows,$15 is a ripoff for a CD but at least it's an actual physical thing & they're taking a risk. $!5 for a download is fucking criminal robbery.

countingcrows,2) we didn't lose a publicist when we left. We already had the best in the business & we paid them ourselves. The company pubs were useless
countingcrows,We get no salary. We're not corp execs who get paid when they're fired for fucking up. We never earn 1 penny unless you get something too.
countingcrows,"And, yes, I do believe we earn our $ fairly. We earn it 2 ways. We sell music and you get music. We sell tkts and you get a show. No extra $"
countingcrows,Record labels don't seem to realize that this thing called the internet exists. They want to charge you $15 for a digital download. I don't.
countingcrows,1) WE left the label because they're incompetent & stuck in the past. They're too stupid to allow anything like the free record I put out
countingcrows,(sigh) Not gonna have an argument but I feel like I should clear up a few misconceptions. Some of you don't understand the record business

countingcrows,Decided I should watch movies that are sort of sad but kinda full of love about crazy people until I understand what the fuck my problem is.

countingcrows,@Galenayers Where are you going? I was gonna fly right now but my little Valentine project kept me up all week so I'm resting. Tonite or tmw
countingcrows,@lraymizoram Got no problems w/the bands at all. I just think the Grammy's are a pile of shit. I love the bands. What are u talking about?
countingcrows,"@ElectricPencils No. I did not. Now I don't know whether to post it now for Europe or not. Hey @Galenayers , Good Morning Galen my luv!"
countingcrows,One thing I can definitely tell you about this song is that it is most certainly NOT the song you're expecting. Hope it makes you smile.
countingcrows,@stellademont That's from DON'T LOOK BACK. Have you seen the movie. It's amazing.
countingcrows,SHAZAM! I just recorded my Valentines Day Finale. Song #7 for Day 7 is done. What a perfect week for a great Valentines Day! LA here I come!
countingcrows,Hey Stella @stellademont I came so so close to making that my final Valentine's Day song. My friend Aurore suggested it and I almost used it
countingcrows,"RT @stellademont: People carry roses,
And make promises by the hours,
My love she laughs like the flowers,
Valentines can't buy her."
countingcrows,I picked a very simple super-smile of a song for the Valentines Day Finale. Turns out it's a really friggin' hard song in disguise! Not fair
countingcrows,@ElectricPencils Not yet. I'm in full-on ValentineExhaustion mode
countingcrows,I am impressed that Arcade Fire won though. I love that record. Shocking. PS. The Cars & DEVO were revolutionary incredible bands in the day
countingcrows,"RT @JDGAFFLIN @countingcrows On a lighter note, have you decided on a song for tomorrow? I GOT A GREAT SONG FOR TMW! STILL CAN'T PLAY IT THO"
countingcrows,"1977 Grammy for Best Record goes to A Taste of Honey for""Boogie Oogie Oogie"". Don't fool yourself. Sucked then, sucks now. Same old Same old"

countingcrows,@deadaselvis I know what you mean. @ ex-gf's in a row w/Yorkies and they shit & pissed all over my house. Loved 'em but WTF? Who does that?
countingcrows,"Come to a concert cuz u love music, I'll be there to play for u cuz I do too. They wanna have award shows, I'll be here learning tmw's song."
countingcrows,That's why I hate them @deadaselvis . They mix up a fan's love of music with this stupid contest. I'd so much rather have fan than an award.
countingcrows,"Ah, I lost my temper again. Sorry @deadaselvis . Sometimes...it bummed me out that someone who liked our band bitched me out over awards."
countingcrows,I'm not crazy about whiny jealous motherfuckers. I spent 10yrs struggling in the clubs to get a chance & I work my ass off every day now.
countingcrows,"Oh, & I'm not ""over being rich & famous"". That's fun. I'm over u talking like I didn't do all the work to earn it. I work hard for a living."
countingcrows,"Hey dipshit @deadaselvis , I appreciate that u bought our records & I love that u liked our band. But I appreciate YOU, not the Grammys"
countingcrows,RT @deadaselvis: @countingcrows hey I bought records of yours that won you the stupid astronaut award thanks for being a RICH and FAMOUS ...
countingcrows,"On a positive note, I didn't waste my evening. Found a different song for tmw & it's perfect. Makes me happy. Smiling just thinking about it"
countingcrows,I think the TONY awards are completely cool but theatre is live performance. It's just like what we do. I dig that. That would be an honor.
countingcrows,I don't think I ever went to an Award Show til the Oscar Nomination. Thought that would've looked funny at mom & dad's house. That I wanted.
countingcrows,"""bitter for losing to Sheryl""? What did we lose to Sheryl? I know we won that stupid astronaut but I wasn't at ANY of those shows Grammys?"
countingcrows,"Actually, there WERE great bands on the show tonight. I take that part back. I object to the whole idea of the Grammy's. It's not a contest."

countingcrows,I'd like a diferent song. I realize now though that they take all night cuz it's just very hard to play a song well when u just learned it.

countingcrows,"It's still got some ""screw you"" though. To quote me: ""no matter whose fault it is, at some point someone leaves &, well u know, fuck them."""
countingcrows,"Like I said last night, I changed Dylan's lyrics to fit me. In his song it's all the girl's fault; in my life it's usually mostly mine"
countingcrows,I can't decide btwn the 2 & I can't sing this anymore if I wanna still record the final song tonite so I'm just gonna give u both. Screw it.
countingcrows,The effects of staying up all night singing are pretty evident. My voice is gone later but the song is strangely more relaxed if slurry.
countingcrows,Here's the deal: I have 2 imperfect but very different takes on this song. 1st is on one piano @ around 1:30AM & 2nd on another piano at 7AM
countingcrows,"Everyone should follow @ElectricPencils ,especially tmw if you're traveling to Oklahoma for the famous Olive Garden Naked Valentine Festival"
countingcrows,"RT @ElectricPencils: For V-Day, was thinking about drinking alone & naked, but that seems selfish, so I'm going to do it at Olive Garden ..."
countingcrows,"And, yes, I'm still up. It's 7:15 & I'm still up. My voice is gone though so I'm done for tonite. Either I already got it or I'll get it tmw"
countingcrows,"The biggest problem is that it's really fast so I'm howlin AND it's hard to play. If I'm not blowing the lyric, I'm screwing the piano part"
countingcrows,"I still left a little ""nasty"" in there though. Y'know, no matter whose fault it is, at some point someone leaves &, well you know, fuck them"
countingcrows,Problem is it's a Dylan song & I know it but I changed lyrics to fit me. In his song it's all the girl's fault; in my life it's usually mine
countingcrows,There is no way. I refuse to believe this is gonna be another night like last night. And the night before. And the night before that. And...
countingcrows,Tomorrow's song? Ugh...I dunno. I've played it 100 times & totally blown out my voice screaming the vocal. It's so fun. I gotta get it right
