faroutakhtar,My name is Farhan and I'm out of here.... Love you all. Peace out.
faroutakhtar,@adnan15 I'm as conditioned as you to find it disturbing.
faroutakhtar,@Punankashmir we are. check the encyclopedia.
faroutakhtar,"Angry with myself for not having spoken, at times, when I should have. Never ever again."
faroutakhtar,"@sushmitsarkar Is it ever too late, unless your making 2 minute eggs."
faroutakhtar,The only person in control of your life is you. Be the master of your own fate. The captain of your soul.

faroutakhtar,@NajeebSheikh already have. where were you?
faroutakhtar,"More often than not, irrelevant stuff is made an issue! Focus on the real deal."
faroutakhtar,@chethn Scream! Here too. But not just here.
faroutakhtar,Request Shiv Sena to push for justice in the Goa rape case... requires more attention than SRK's personal opinion.

faroutakhtar,Bring back public stonings in cases like this! (9yr old raped). Theres a couple of rocks I've had my eye on!

faroutakhtar,Shahrukh's best performance till date. Karan's best film. What else can you ask for?
faroutakhtar,"MNIK is an amazing film. Full power to Karan, Shahrukh, Kajol, Ravi K Chandran (DOP), Deepa Bhatia (editor) and the rest! Outstanding!"
faroutakhtar,Off for a meeting now. chat soon. the best way that you can show support for MNIK and cock a snoot at the madness is go watch it fearlessly.
faroutakhtar,"@pramrith If you stop believing it's possible, it will be impossible."
faroutakhtar,There is no need for anyone to be afraid in face of this sort of hooliganism! There are laws and we have faith in them protecting us.

faroutakhtar,@swarna619 Will put the names of sites up by tuesday as they will only be active post the 20th ie the official launch date.
faroutakhtar,@orkutfreake don't agree with any justification for denying someone their due. You even have the choice to download 1 song officially...
faroutakhtar,"Anyway, the Cd in stores on the 20th and there are sites where you can officially download. Enjoy!"
faroutakhtar,@bhaumikananda It is eventually the conscience of the downloader that decides his or her action.... all we can do is appeal.
faroutakhtar,@orkutfreake in that case it should be okay to steal a car you can't afford or shoplift something you fancy but can't purchase
faroutakhtar,@raj19nitk thats right but Cd's have been dispatched to stores and I guess someone got overexcited along the way.
faroutakhtar,@loveaaj1 Hi there to all fans in Italy. My first film was shot in Venice by the way. Luv
faroutakhtar,And Dad says thank you for the birthday greetings. Now off to focus on my breathing and work off the lunch... ciao
