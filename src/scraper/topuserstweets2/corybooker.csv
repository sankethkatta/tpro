corybooker,"RT @ToughieTweets: Not only would he have done them sooner, he would have done them when Bush was president. Because that makes sense."
corybooker,Only difference I see is Romney has a bigger flag pin. RT @phatkeke: But Romney restated what Obama said. What is his differentiator?
corybooker,"Obama to Romney about his foreign policy re Iran: ""You say you would do the same things we did but you would just say them louder."""
corybooker,Romney supports Obama sanctions and actions related to Iran yet he claims he would have done them sooner &amp; more severely.
corybooker,Both men making strong unequivocal affirmations of our alliance with Israel.
corybooker,RT @abaesel2: horses and bayonet line was dead-on accurate and very clever. My fave zinger of the night.
corybooker,"Obama: ""If Israel is attacked I will stand with Israel."" We have strong military coalition and continue to work together."
corybooker,Obama Calling out MR for not understanding modern military preparedness. Yes we have less ships but we have less horses and bayonets too.
corybooker,RT @scott_english: No one can balance the federal budget by cutting discretionary spending. It is just 1/3rd of the total.
corybooker,Obama calling out MR math: 5 trillion of tax cuts. 2 trill increase in additional military spending they aren't asking for = deficit growth
corybooker,"Romney talking about cutting programs in ""discretionary spending"" but won't name them."
corybooker,Foreign policy debate has taken a domestic policy intermission.
corybooker,Romney can't claim to get us on track to a balanced budget if he says he will increase military spending and give massive tax cuts
corybooker,"U support Romney. But u don't ""revolt me"" we're both Americans RT @Oats897: The fact u support obama on party lines is revolting. Shame on u"
corybooker,Romney says he wouldn't cut military spending. Obama ended the expensive war in Iraq &amp; saved US dollars (&amp; more importantly soldiers lives)
corybooker,"Romney stating we must strengthen the US military. Yes, but we should not be giving them resources that even the Pentagon isn't asking for"
corybooker,MR continues 2 agree with BO on Syria &amp; Egypt. Now he's giving praise 2 the US military. They deserve praise but that's not foreign policy
corybooker,"""What's going 2 make Egyptian revolution successful is that the young ppl see opportunity""so we've been helping with economic strategy Obama"
corybooker,"""What you heard Governor Romney say is that he doesn't have different ideas"" on Syria. President Obama"
corybooker,"When it comes to specifics, Romney seems to be having a difficult time distinguishing his ideas on foreign policy/Syria from the President's"
corybooker,"Ahh, your literal interpretation is pun-tastic.  RT @shan_phil: shouldn't foreign policy be all over the map?"
corybooker,Obama reiterating that we must use caution and prudence before involving ourselves with arms or troops.
corybooker,"""I've learned as Commander and Chief that you have to be clear."" Obama calling out Romney for his shifting positions."
corybooker,"Obama calling Mitt out for a foreign policy agenda that is ""all over the map""."
corybooker,"How can MR claim there's a ""Rising tide of chaos"" in Middle East &amp; link it to Al-Qaeda when Obama Admin has made strides in eliminating them"
corybooker,"""Transitioning out of Afghanistan in a responsible manner"" Obama - PBO telling truth of his success in Middle East and plan going ahead."

corybooker,Romney using Ronald Regan era as an example of how to create growth. But tax rates were much higher then than now. AND Obama did cut taxes
corybooker,It is on his web site - take a look. RT @zayin2007: what is Romney's 5 pt plan and why not spell it out here/now?
corybooker,I think she is doing well &amp; keeping them moving RT @HankEstrada: I like her too BUT she lost control and they are walking all over her role.
corybooker,Interesting - Obama pointing out that Bush didn't attack planned parenthood and Romney has.
corybooker,Fair &amp; True. But it is relevant and I thought a good point. RT @johannacamba: but woman health wasn't the question.
corybooker,Great question on how is Romney different from Bush? Romney had some good and actually specific answers.
corybooker,"U can say u are ""pro woman"" but do u support access to health care for women, preventative care, equal pay? Obama makes good point."
corybooker,Would Romney have supported the Equal Pay law that congress passed &amp; Obama signed? He didn't answer that question.
corybooker,"Yes, please just go to the obama campaign web site they are detailed there &amp; more RT @88SCLUCCI78: is there link to what those 17taxes were?"
corybooker,And you are a fellow American. U have my respect not my mean spirited name calling. RT @fultonrm: u are a idiot

corybooker,"I like it, I don't think its yelling. He is sounding firm, strong &amp; determined RT @MarkModesti: Obama needs to quit yelling!"
corybooker,"Obama has done it. He cut taxes on average family by $3,600. He cut taxes on small businesses 17 times."
corybooker,Romney didn't answer question! What deductions!? He can't claim to pay for his rate cuts without ending deductions or deficit will increase
corybooker,"Love this question! Romney, tell us which deductions you would cut! Give us specifics."
corybooker,"No, US natural gas production is up. RT @melissaannehays: I know for a fact he's not producing more natural gas."
corybooker,Obama standing up to Romney! Challenging his distortions of truth. America drilling and producing more oil &amp; natural gas than Bush
corybooker,"Yes! Obama is drilling in more places, w/ more oil wells &amp;more pipe lines &amp; investing in clean coal tech &amp; alternative energy #AllOfTheAbove"
corybooker,RT @pdcaton: Romney plan was to cut Pell by 19%
corybooker,Now Romney is actually saying he would have done the same thing with the auto industry as Obama did #Disbelief!
