andy_murray,"@AlexCorretja74 great to see spanish davis cup captain alex corretja in paris, one of the nicest guys you will meet #meboy"
andy_murray,"First match in paris tonight vs mathieu at 730 local time, pumped for it #happyhalloween"
andy_murray,@tomncollier its normally the best physically or tactically that wins the race
andy_murray,@tomncollier of course there is skill at the top end of all sports but in cycling it isn't the decisive factor in winning or losing
andy_murray,@mr_rossi_ sport now... And its up to the others to follow
andy_murray,@mr_rossi_ I agree if you read 2 lines of a 2 minute answer I gave it doesn't sound good. Cycling has the best anti doping programme in..
andy_murray,@mr_rossi_ maybe you can help me here? Do all cyclists have daily coaching on technique etc?
andy_murray,@mr_rossi_ I'm very aware of the skill and physical endurance required to be a top cyclist..Very very tough sport one of the toughest
andy_murray,@SimonWilliams21 was asked to compare 2 sports... I believe one is much more physically demanding and the other is more skillfully demanding
andy_murray,@SimonWilliams21 cycling one of the most physically demanding sports in the world... What did I say about drugs that was incorrect?
andy_murray,First games of @NBA season tonight...good luck @MiamiHEAT vs boston #defendingchamps
andy_murray,@MTBTR good idea:) could raise some money for bio passports across more sport!
andy_murray,@MTBTR knowing if any little choice of the wrong word or phrase will make you look like an idiot
andy_murray,@MTBTR I wasn't trying to say anything bad about cycling.. I was trying to compare the 2 sports in front of journalists which isn't easy!
andy_murray,"@MTBTR I don't think it is ""just"" physical as I'm sure I would hit the deck cycling at 60mph however I believe it is a very large part of it"
andy_murray,@MTBTR ideally every sport would have a bio passport....
andy_murray,@MTBTR so no sport requires more or less skill than another one? And no sport is more or less physical than another?
andy_murray,@MTBTR didn't doubt for one second that the testing in cycling is better than tennis.. I said there needs to be much more testing in tennis
andy_murray,@MTBTR however I believe there is more skill involved in tennis...and I said that there needs to be much more testing in tennis...
andy_murray,@MTBTR long distance cycling is physically one of the hardest sports out there.. Without doubt more demanding than tennis...
andy_murray,@MTBTR exactly what did I say that was bullshit?
andy_murray,@Becker_Boris hahaha did you try fitting in the lockers back in ur day too?
