stevenbjohnson,"That said, I fully expect Apple to revise the home screen and introduce some kind of file concept. Can't do everything in v1."
stevenbjohnson,That the iPad lacks the UI concept of files/docs is a much bigger deal than no multitasking. (Me in January: http://bit.ly/bvyjji)

stevenbjohnson,Anyone who thinks the iPad is a tool for media consumption not production needs to build a deck in the Keynote app. A total joy to use.
