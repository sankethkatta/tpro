davidgregory,What i like so far is that they are both engaging each other and Schieffer is in total control
davidgregory,Romney doesnt want another iraq or af and doesnt want us war in syria. Striking less bellicose tone so far.

davidgregory,Obama - all over the map means America is less safe. President making clear hes actually been commander in chief. #NBCPolitics

davidgregory,Like line about Romney listening to elevator music #newgeneration

davidgregory,Ryan comes off as more wonkish than inspiring but they love him inside the hall.
davidgregory,Ryan reflects the new strain of fiscal conservatism in the party but fails to acknowledge how much debt was accumulated by GOP.
