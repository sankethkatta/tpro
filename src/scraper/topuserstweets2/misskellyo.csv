misskellyo,@DianneN1221 hahaha i dont think anyone would take the job! being me is way to hard/stressful it will also include way to much apologizing!
misskellyo,@ALYstorme you should still follow them if you are a fun because they still post info like tour dates and where they will be!
misskellyo,AAAAAAAAAAnd how i am constantly unintentionally putting my foot in my mouth!
misskellyo,well you know its the real me because of my shit grammar!
misskellyo,my mum thinks she tweets but its really her dictating what to write to either me or her assistant so i guess it counts! @MrsSOsbourne
misskellyo,but half of me feels like its wrong because your not being real to the people that follow you! what do you guys think?

misskellyo,@BellsThornettes thats funny because we have never met i dont know you from adam & you only know of me! who is really being mean here? #you!
