realjohngreen,@rebeccadecz #readpenguin To me the novel is more of a broad examination of what constitutes a well-lived life. #readpenguin
realjohngreen,@rebeccadecz #readpenguin I don't really think of fiction as being a message-delivery vehicle. At least not single messages. #readpenguin
realjohngreen,@JulianneMarz #readpenguin Sometimes I'm confident; usually I'm not. Those feelings don't always line up with reader opinions. #readpenguin

realjohngreen,"Arrived in Hamburg. Still being trailed by lovely TV people. Everyone keeps asking who I am. ""Just a writer,"" I say. Then they leave. :)"
realjohngreen,Guys I am being interviewed by German TV right now and they are so nice. I love this country. The show is heute-journal!
realjohngreen,"In five and a half years, I've never tried this hard to get a vlogbrothers video online. Hopefully....in a few hours...."
realjohngreen,Not brimming with confidence that there will be a vlogbrothers video tomorrow but I will do my best. Really really really trying.
realjohngreen,Greetings from a German macbook with crazy German keyboard. Good news: Got computer backed up. Bad news: Computer fried.
realjohngreen,"I have more than 1000 emails now. You are amazing and very generous, although everyone had competing advice and I don't know who to trust."
realjohngreen,@porschefanatec can't. In an airport.
realjohngreen,"The issue is that the computer eventually started up but many programs--Skype, chrome, final cut, e.g.--won't load. Comp is like 1 month old"
realjohngreen,I need a mac expert's help (am in an airport and won't be close to a genius bar for two weeks). If able to help email sparksflyup at gmail.
realjohngreen,"On the upside, the 8,000 words of my new story have been backed up. So. Yeah. That. Is. A. Huge. Relief. But without final cut, no vlogbros."
realjohngreen,Okay. After loading forever my macbook restarted (yay!) but now chrome/final cut express/many other programs won't load? WHAT IS GOING ON?
realjohngreen,This may mean no vlogbrothers video this week. Also that I have lost 8000 words of my new novel.

realjohngreen,@colleenhoover ...value for me as a reader (when I'm reading) and what creates the most value for my readers (when I'm writing).

realjohngreen,@YancyUnger The sample size is too large for me to influence those ratings. That's why you can rely on goodreads more than amazon.

realjohngreen,@EliseOgden yup.
realjohngreen,"@CulturalSavage Good question. I think it's the default setting for self-publishing. A good book can't be made by one person, imho."
realjohngreen,"@skittledog Right, but amazon reviews are totally unreliable, because a huge % of them are paid for by authors or publishers."
realjohngreen,"@YancyUnger That's true. But on average, people rate popular traditionally published books A LOT higher than popular self-published ebooks."
realjohngreen,"@DaChough8 I may work up a spreadsheet, but no it's based on my own observation."
realjohngreen,"Without traditional publishing, the kindle becomes a device that mostly sells work kindle users claim not to like that much."
realjohngreen,The goodreads data on self-published ebooks (which is far more reliable than oft-manipulated Amazon reviews) is pretty damning.
realjohngreen,What Bezos isn't saying: Most of the top-selling self-published kindle books are--according to their readers--not very good.
realjohngreen,@xLoveToReadx ...any more than the radical language in the Republican party platform represents the opinions of most American Republicans.

realjohngreen,@araceligarland Thanks. And don't be embarrassed. It's not a function of Sumner County. It's a nationwide thing.

realjohngreen,@onedecadelater My response is that ideological rigidity and refusal to compromise are not assets to a political party or our country.
realjohngreen,@chrisweitz thanks for the kind word about tfios. I loved A Better Life. Ot has really stuck with me.
realjohngreen,@RoyalGreenGirl1 sorry! SLEEP!
realjohngreen,Sarah is reading Sendak books to Henry. Henry doesn't know a person made WILD THINGS. And he doesn't need to. The story survives.
realjohngreen,"@RoyalGreenGirl1 Just because of one retweet?!?!?! ;) Seriously, though, you have to click unfollow. No hard feelings I promise!"
realjohngreen,@wesleyroth I picked up a Republican ballot today. I'm disappointed by the dearth of moderate voices in the party.
realjohngreen,RT @thinkprogress: Six-term Senator Dick Lugar (R-IN) ousted in primary. REASON: There is no such thing anymore as a moderate Republican ...
realjohngreen,@lindsayism @LenaDunham Ditto. I want to be her. Except I think it would be very stressful.

realjohngreen,"@mgnwrites To be clear, I didnt invent the term hanko de mayo; it was popularized by the Mexican American nerdfighter group in our old forum"
realjohngreen,@Whogaterscape awesome!
realjohngreen,"@mgnwrites I'm not making fun of Mexican culture of cinco de mayo. It's a pun, not a joke. Anyway, sorry if I'm wrong/out of line."
