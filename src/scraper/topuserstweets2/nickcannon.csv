nickcannon,"When you hate, you are doing more damage to yourself than the individual you are hating"
nickcannon,I don't I have ever hated any one in my life. Disliked quite a few... but never hated.
nickcannon,@caps_crazy1 What does possessing hate do for you?

nickcannon,Sad thing is religion and rules turn more people away from God than towards him. GOD is LOVE. #AGAPE
nickcannon,"Funny thing is a lot of people don't even know Jesus was Jewish. ""Yeshua descended from Abraham the Hebrew"" Y'all don't get me started..."
nickcannon,"I worship God with my spirit not with my religion. If you have a real relationship with God, rules don't matter."
nickcannon,FACT: The most segregated time in America is Sunday Mornings. Religion continues to divide the world instead of bringing us together
nickcannon,"The Bible is compiled of stories on how God dealt with man. We are to learn from them and then ask ""God how will you deal with me?'"
nickcannon,"""Religions are just a man's interpretation of God's Omnipotence"""
nickcannon,Throughout History most Wars were fought over religion. Why does serving God have to be a contest?
nickcannon,"People need to understand God doesn't care what religion you are or what church you go to, but what's in your heart."
