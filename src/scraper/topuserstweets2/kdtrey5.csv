kdtrey5,@bmoe_careful he never played he dont know more than any player
kdtrey5,@bmoe_careful no they wasn't where did u get that from
kdtrey5,@bmoe_careful we talking about him as a player! And they were in the playoffs every yr

kdtrey5,@waldorfsfinest nah
kdtrey5,@bmoe_careful then why shaq n penny didn't win?
kdtrey5,@waldorfsfinest yes he is and I can honestly say that
kdtrey5,@bmoe_careful wasn't one like Kobe back then
kdtrey5,@waldorfsfinest means he still got it..top3
kdtrey5,@bmoe_careful then in that case put Kobe wit any other dominate center n they win..dummy
kdtrey5,@waldorfsfinest u think those numbers are easy to get at 34 years old and almost 1000 games on ur legs at a high level??
kdtrey5,@bmoe_careful then why he ain't it 16 championships
kdtrey5,@bmoe_careful he wouldn't won without Kobe u stupid
kdtrey5,@bmoe_careful he wouldn't have won without kobe
kdtrey5,@waldorfsfinest he's still athletic not as before of course but still athletic and gets a bucket...efficiently..like I said 26-6-5..
kdtrey5,@waldorfsfinest wit 2 chips n da last 3 years smh what more he gotta do?

kdtrey5,@Jayreese7 tell me how it's showing? Cuz they lost? Ok so
kdtrey5,@waldorfsfinest what good points are he making
kdtrey5,@bmoe_careful so in that case every play that score 30 and win a game can be the best player n the league
kdtrey5,"@bmoe_careful how he gonna be one of the best of all time n he still playing but not one of the best right now, sounds dumb"
kdtrey5,@bmoe_careful your always wrong! 110 percent of the time your wrong!

kdtrey5,@bmoe_careful how does he make better plays?
kdtrey5,@bmoe_careful Vick shouldn't be n da Convo..Peyton u can argue..Vick no..
kdtrey5,@bmoe_careful Vick is better cuz he can scramble better?
kdtrey5,@bmoe_careful so ur saying Brady is an average QB?

kdtrey5,@waldorfsfinest everybody agreed with me..u like flash and that's fine...I analyze the sport in and out..
kdtrey5,@bmoe_careful without a doubt he is the number one pick he jus waiting to see what team gets the 1st pick
kdtrey5,@waldorfsfinest yea but score better...just like denard a better runner than passer..
kdtrey5,@waldorfsfinest shoelace is a better running back then quarterback
kdtrey5,@bmoe_careful I'm speaking on being the heisman man..
kdtrey5,@bmoe_careful of course it's pressure...Andrew luck right now is a better QB then cam newton is right now..I'd bet that
kdtrey5,@bmoe_careful Troy smith won the heisman a few years back and he was the 110th pick so what does the heisman mean?
kdtrey5,RT @jrlbronc: @KDTrey5 the bottom line is every draft expert say Andrew Luck is the best college prospect since... John Elway..
kdtrey5,Lol nooo man RT @waldorfsfinest: Andrew Luck didn't come out of college because he knew Cam Newton was gonna b the # 1 pick  #letsbereal
kdtrey5,"@bmoe_careful lol what about Brett favre, Dan Marino, Aaron Rodgers, Matt Ryan, Phillip rivers, mike Vick, jus to name a few"
kdtrey5,@waldorfsfinest my point exactly
kdtrey5,@waldorfsfinest a real QB is like a real pg...who's the best pg n da NBA to u? Rondo right?
kdtrey5,He chose to bypass on the nfl he woulda been number 1..RT @waldorfsfinest: The bottom line is Andrew luck still in college
kdtrey5,Yea he was 2nd in the voting RT @bmoe_careful: what's so great about Andrew Luck? was he up for the heisman last yr..? oh!
kdtrey5,Ask around RT @bmoe_careful: @KDTrey5 no way in hell u pass on him! i dont believe they said that!
kdtrey5,No doubt RT @LOCK_SKYWALKER: @KDTrey5 Yeah we would have but killa cam is still gonna do work
