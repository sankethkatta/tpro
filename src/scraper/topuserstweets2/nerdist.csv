nerdist,@zeuscomics I'll double check w/ our interns &amp; if they even remotely did what you're accusing I'll pull the show. But I promise they didn't.
nerdist,"@zeuscomics you don't have to accuse people of things when you get mad, sir. It's just as unfair to me as you think it is to you."
nerdist,"@zeuscomics Again, I have little to do w/ the creative on that show other than approving scripts. Ask @NerdternsShow if you have concerns."
nerdist,@zeuscomics That was 2 years ago. Is it that hard to believe that I may not remember it? Certainly not intentional! Just a long time ago.
nerdist,@zeuscomics I've never stolen ANYTHING in my life and I really don't appreciate the insinuation. At all.
nerdist,@zeuscomics Ok...once again...I didn't have anything to do with the writing or creation of the show. It was pitched to me by our interns.
nerdist,@zeuscomics I'm sorry man! Please forgive me for not having watched it! When was that?
nerdist,@TheLos @zeuscomics @ThatKevinSmith agreed! there are probably even more that none of us know about.
nerdist,@zeuscomics No reason you should stop doing it though! I'll give it a watch.
nerdist,"@zeuscomics Not to mention I've never seen @variants myself. Apologies! You know about Comic Book Men, right? That's another one."
nerdist,"@zeuscomics for anyone who works in a store, it's not a huge leap to make to do a show about it. I'm sorry! (though I didn't do anything)"
nerdist,"@zeuscomics Not sure you're suggesting, but I had NOTHING to do with the idea or creation of this show, and our interns aren't aware of you."
nerdist,"@zeuscomics thanks! but theyre our actual interns. They pitched, produced, wrote, directed and starred in the show."
