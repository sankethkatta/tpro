nickkristof,"Good to hear Biden call ""capital gains"" a loophole. it should indeed be taxed at personal income rates, as it was under Reagan."
nickkristof,Impressive &amp; substantive debate all around. Ryan very solid. Biden at his best. And I'm voting Radditz for VP!
nickkristof,"Biden is pretty good at being sarcastic and lacerating, without coming across as nasty."
nickkristof,I hope Biden is as skeptical of military action against Iran when he's in the Sit Room as in the debate.
