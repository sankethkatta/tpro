mus,@mneylon Well dotMusic is not the same as .music unfortunately. It will confuse people. dotmusic used to be a Yahoo owned music company too
mus,"@mneylon Guess it is the equivalent of searching for ""music"" on Google. Means the same as "".music"" . Search engines are not yet smart enough"
mus,"@mneylon I guess Twitter assumes "".music"" = ""music"" This one will be very tough. Most musicians search "".music"" not ""dotMusic"" though"
mus,"@mneylon Yea, we need to deal with political games with everything we do unfortunately."
mus,@2loose_buzzgoth You mean like this: Check out #.music Maybe there will be an issue with the dot huh? Thanks for the advice
mus,"@Simon_Ashaan Thanks Simon! Were excited cause we received 550,000+ support signatures virally thanks to people like you. Spread the word!"
mus,@mneylon I think the whole trademark issue is getting a bit out of hand. Who would want to register Toyota.flowers for example. For .com yes
mus,"@mhegge Our name is listed as "".Music"" in twitter but can not be found by musicians looking for our company in the search results. Help!"
mus,"@andr8a Our name is listed as "".Music"" in twitter but can not be found by musicians looking for our company in the search results. Help!"
mus,@delbius Thanks! I appreciate the help and rock on
mus,@mneylon It is common but I am guessing the governing body wants to protect itself from lawsuits so is very careful with the process.
mus,@ghettoradio hey is ghettoradio.fm your site?
mus,"@delbius Hey just wanted to ask how I can get my company name "".Music"" (dotMusic) found in search results. You in LA as well? Thanks!"
mus,@mneylon You have no idea Michele. I get 50 emails a day from bands wanting their .music domain. We're ready to go. Years of anticipation
mus,@mneylon Not yet. Hopefully there will be more emphasis on the at-large community in the process. Process is taking ages that's for sure
mus,@mixengineer Sounds great man. Would love to hear some acoustic stuff
mus,@delwilliams Tell me about it. Not sure we will ever find another artist just like him. What a shame
mus,@sue_daydreamer Thanks Sue! Did you sign the .music petition? If so we will give you first look to our powerful backend. Very excited
mus,@melodyvocals What I meant will they be interested in your band enough to convert to superfans. Problem is theyre not there to see you
mus,@beyonddomaining Interesting discussion with Latona. I still think developing full sites is the best solution.
mus,"@delwilliams I think Michael Jackson will make his money back with his tour. Crazy how fast he sold out. Then again, I got tickets too"
mus,@mixengineer What kind of songs are you mixing?
mus,@_strummerville Indeed my friend. Hopefully we will get .music released for the web community in early 2010. Strummerville.music - i like it
mus,"@mintyfreshmusic Well even if the acts are similar in genre, aren't the fans usually impatient for the main act to come on?"
mus,@sue_daydreamer Glad you think I am cool! hahah Rock on
mus,@sue_daydreamer Rock on Sue!
mus,Bow Wow Addresses Lackluster Sales; Says He's Retiring. Will more superstars follow? I guess theyre lucky cause they can just tour to recoup
mus,Bono urged Universal Music Chairman Doug Morris to meet with Google CEO Eric Schmidt to work together. What will Vevo success factors be?
mus,Is touring as an opening act good? Better to play to your loyal fans and grow them slowly or try to persuade other bands' fans to like you?
mus,"@redguitarfreak Touring is tough because you need fans in local areas to come see your band. If you know where the fans are, you go there"
mus,@_strummerville Yea I read his book on the future of music. Very interesting stuff. He said he has to wait until October due to conflicts
mus,@SunnyTuff Well seems soundexchange is working on that but who knows. Everything is up in the air
mus,@dotfm  Music.fm rocks :)
mus,"@Lisa_Chemberlin Sure. Well they say we dont want to pay you, so well just remove the videos instead. Interesting tactic huh?"
mus,@_strummerville That is funny. The Futurist might be joining our board of advisors for .music domain name extension. Yes this makes sense
mus,@Lisa_Chemberlin They claim zero profits with youtube. They are not interested in compensating rightsholders. They remove videos instead.
mus,@audocs wow you are right my friend
mus,@SpitBaby Ask Songwriter Peter Waterman. Hey bands can tour but how about songwriters? Should be interesting to see how this pans out. Vevo?
mus,@thematthewshow Subscription with all you can access will be the future of recorded music.Touring is important but only rockstars make big$
mus,@redkattseven I say be personal with your fans and build long term relationships. Then grow them and add more numbers slowly
mus,@Simon_Ashaan The majors nuts are running out of sperm my friend. You are right. They are shrinking.
mus,@jriley1762 I saw Freese play live with SO many bands. This guy is pure genius. And he can drum. But then again he is a celebrity player
mus,@ericdanielsax It is why we make music right? Goal here is to increase the superfan numbers. 200 superfans &gt; 50000 myspace fans
mus,"Rick Astley's ""Never Gonna Give You Up"" viewed 154 million times on Youtube. Songwriter's check from Google: $16.30. Any views on this?"
mus,"@jriley1762 yes I believe in the superfan concept. Get sponsored, get private bookings to perform for fans or broadcast live for them"
mus,@Simon_Ashaan I see alot of internet rights issues here. U2's McGuinness has been for this. I dont get it. Compare U2 CD vs touring sales
mus,@SunnyTuff We need to figure out a system where chart system for streaming can help sales. Why not get rewarded? It's a challenge
mus,@redkattseven Is focusing on superfans a better alternative? Seems there is too much noise with masses. Focus on best fans & grow them
mus,@redguitarfreak The Majors problem is theyre not making what they used to. Indies are becoming more and more important in the industry
mus,@ericdanielsax We need to be flexible & think outside the box but getting mass appeal is harder than ever. Superfans might be where its at
mus,French Parliament rejects bill that requires ISPs to suspend access to users receiving 3 warnings for illegal music downloading
mus,"@LilTtheKingBee I firmly believe in the end its all about the music. Image dies, music does not. Keep working on it man. People will listen"
mus,@kryanhdg Paying consumers have driven the trend for digital music. But there are fans willing to spend $200 on tickets & $0 in digital.
mus,@_strummerville Can you share this water concept? I love new models
mus,@carriearmitage The Beatles are certainly a one in a billion band. But they are still fighting making their music available in digital.
mus,"@thematthewshow Question now is how we are flexible with control, yet create something of value that someone would want to pay money for."
mus,@jriley1762 i think better seats is a great idea. Shame that the scalpers get all the good seats beforehand. So what about indie bands?
mus,@thematthewshow that idea I like. were doing the same thing with our Music.us backend. great stuff
mus,@carriearmitage Amen to that!
mus,@ericdanielsax 100% need a presence there. Its a shame they tanked things for the indie. Their system is so stale. Where is the innovation?
mus,@SonicSkillz I listened to the Myspace Records signed Hollywood Undead on the radio yesterday. That was pretty bad. Im willing to listen
mus,@_strummerville Congrats on the plays. I would love to know why Myspace is not paying you part of their ads like they do with the majors
mus,@tylersummers I agree with you on that one. I am hoping Music.us and .MUSIC will fix these issues. A better one stop destination is needed
mus,@ilter You are so right. Their search is definitely dreadful
mus,@thematthewshow U think creative commons is the future? How about rightsholders who want full control of their work & how it is used?
mus,@carriearmitage Dont you think though that some music is worth more than others? I guess that is all subjective though huh?
mus,Setting up system were artists can custom price each of their products/services (downloads/tickets/merch/live broadcast etc) - www.music.us
mus,"Why am i getting this feeling that Myspace Music is dying. Do all your friends on there really listen to your music? If not, will they ever?"
mus,Do you think the pricing model for music should be based on variable pricing determined by demand? Or a fixed price? Or case-by-case?
mus,@IrmaCamp46 yea it is pretty awesome that is for sure :)
mus,Its amazing the new U2 is not even platinum yet. U2 generates over $100 million per tour. Why not give the album away with each ticket?
mus,@redguitarfreak Yea I think a combo of both ad and subscription might do the trick. I think the big issue today is the pricing is wrong
mus,Integrating the on-demand licensing section with built-in negotiation tools for artists that will use .music domain name - www.music.us
mus,@mitchellmusic You mean the new Cornell album? It is so different. After 3 listens you start realising how diverse Cornell is. What a voice!
mus,@thequills Yea I agree. It is a journey. Especially if the album is mixed in a manner that it is listened to as an album
mus,@Hellrett His new album is great if you are into electronic. Cornell is so diverse it is crazy. Pure genius. However Soundgarden is KING
mus,@virtualhires Well i think they are banking it will be as successful as Hulu. However music and movies/tv shows are two different beasts.
mus,@binaurally Yes they said they might tour again this year
mus,@freefallmusicco Production is fine but seriously not up to par to other brilliant U2 stuff. 2-3 catchy tunes and that is it.
mus,"@harmonicnotes yea, just listened to badmotorfinger  and superunknown yesterday. Wow, made me realize how average today's rock music is"
mus,@leather_head I heard the band performed without Cornell a few weeks ago. Reunion might be a possibility

mus,@ClubFemina Not sure it will be revolutionary. Sounds like Google is trying to appease the majors. They've violated copyrights for years now
mus,@virtualhires Sounds like another attempt by the majors to monetize videos. Youtube isnt paying up. Partnerships are better than lawsuits.
mus,@SunnyTuff Congrats on #3. Made any sales off that? Wondering the effectiveness of different sites's chart systems - C from www.music.us
mus,@lefsetz Glad you are twittering Bob. Great blog btw. Loved Gene Simmons video. I have no respect for people who disrespect others mothers.
mus,@kryanhdg did you see that the $1.29 price decreased sales units  in comparison. However they made a bit more money because of 29% increase
