omarepps,"That said, I just don't think Tebow is that good. Like I said, time will reveal.."
omarepps,I'll say this about Tebow. It sucks that the top brass of the Broncos aren't behind him 100%. I'd like to see him play elsewhere..
omarepps,Aaron Rodgers plays like he's in a video game.. Kudos to his o line..

omarepps,I can't stand the fact that my Cowboys play to the level of their competition! That really irks me!
omarepps,"Ironically enough, I actually picked the Broncos over the Dolphins.. Haha!"
omarepps,And to think I actually picked the Titans to beat the Texans.. Can't win em all.. Picked the Bucs over the Bears too..
