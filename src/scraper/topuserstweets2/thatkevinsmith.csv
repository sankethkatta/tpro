thatkevinsmith,"That's 15yrs ago. Maybe I'll put the ep guide online for folks to read one day. I recall Lee wanted to do a ""Lester goes on MauryPovich"" ep."
thatkevinsmith,"But the thing I liked most I eventually put into ZACK &amp; MIRI: When Lee and his fluffer fucked for the first time, it was oddly romantic."
thatkevinsmith,"In the season-ender, Lee's character &amp; his fluffer buddy would've finally hooked up - thus creating all sorts of plot twists for Season 2."
thatkevinsmith,The friendship between Lee's character and the girl was gonna be will they/wont they all year - as Lee also had a really sweet girlfriend.
thatkevinsmith,CarseyWerner passed with extreme prejudice. Lee &amp; I did DOGMA next. I'd later raid my HIATUS ep guide when writing ZACK &amp; MIRI MAKE A PORNO.
thatkevinsmith,"""No network will do a sitcom about pornography,"" I was told. My point was ""They're not in porn; they're FORMER porn stars."" It didn't wash."
thatkevinsmith,"So I submited it to Carsey/Werner - where Lee was setting up a first-look deal, pre-AMY. Since it's '96/97, their reaction was... befuddled."
thatkevinsmith,And @JayMewes was gonna play another former porn star who'd join Lee in episode 3. His name: Lester the Molester. I wrote a series ep guide.
thatkevinsmith,He opened a comic book store and tried to live a normal life. His best friend: the girl who used to be his fluffer who left porn with him.
