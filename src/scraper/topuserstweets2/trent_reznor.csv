trent_reznor,New NIN dates about to be announced @ http://www.nin.com
trent_reznor,"@RemySoho @AndreaUrbanFox - you are both ignorant, insensitive uniformed cunts. A ""prostitute"" and a pig."

trent_reznor,"Plus, Mew sound so good live it kind of pisses me off."
trent_reznor,Our last show in Germany was a good one.  Thank you Berlin!  Hotter than fuck onstage.

trent_reznor,@ALEC_EMPIRE in t-minus 10 minutes!
trent_reznor,Looking forward to playing with @ALEC_EMPIRE tomorrow night!
trent_reznor,"A dreary AM drive through Poland. 3 shows in a row all with long, bumpy, overnight drives and no showers. Glamorous."
trent_reznor,"Eric is doing very badly. I am concentrating on having faith, not fear. Pls God, pls have mercy on #Eric (via @VeronicaDLCruz)"
trent_reznor,Is it bad that I want to go home already after one show in Europe?
trent_reznor,"It would have been nice to finish the set, but someone kicked the plug out.  Sorry."
trent_reznor,@Mariqueen and I are an unstoppable force of greatness - so SUCK IT.
trent_reznor,"And fuck you, trolls.  I'll tweet if I feel like it."
trent_reznor,Just visited my 1st Euro festival toilet.  This shit is on!

trent_reznor,Returning to the land that spawned me today.
trent_reznor,"If you contributed to helping #Eric (or are thinking of doing so), you should watch this.  http://bit.ly/YoEmw"
trent_reznor,Can someone record / upload the interview w @VeronicaDLCruz on Morning show w Mike & Juliet please?
trent_reznor,And no she's not with me and that's not my room.  I have zebra print.
trent_reznor,That's Josie and she's fine.She was abducted (aliens) as a pup and occasionally gets weird mutant growths in her paws.Milking the attention.
trent_reznor,Greyhound in sickbay!  http://twitpic.com/6wtgp

trent_reznor,"RT @sidragon: Google for ""greater Internet fuckwad theory"" and it all becomes clear."
trent_reznor,Play the victim now you miserable fuck.
trent_reznor,"@Fredgarrett is your man!  He obviously wants attention so HERE IT FUCKING IS, AND FUCK YOU."
trent_reznor,... has nothing better to do with his utterly unremarkable life than to come up bullshit about me and repost hate tweets...
trent_reznor,"Twitter people:  if you're a bitter, jealous asshole and hate me and my fiance and you need a kindred soul who..."
trent_reznor,What fucking rock did you crawl out from under @Fredgarrett?  Jesus Christ this place is filled with assholes.
trent_reznor,Seriously:  FUCK YOU.  Don't you fucking dare drag #Eric into whatever in the fuck point you're trying to make.
trent_reznor,Today's example of... I don't even know what this confused asshole is trying to say.  Enjoy.  http://bit.ly/WpLmW  Fuck you Fred.
trent_reznor,Have a great show @mariqueen  - we're onstage at the same time.  XO

trent_reznor,Excellent Magnetic Fields cover!  http://bit.ly/eNfU
trent_reznor,I have been sober for 8 years today (where I am).  Thanks for letting me share that with you.  Proud of that.
trent_reznor,and with that.. BLOW ME! - I'm going to go play a show!
trent_reznor,The price of attempting to engage an online community is high and probably ultimately not worth weeding through the sewage.
trent_reznor,Easy: encountering real people in the real world mostly = love.  Reading bullshit online from anonymous cowards = hate.
trent_reznor,RT @macegr: should start a count of how many times per week @trent_reznor yo-yo's between love and hate of humanity.
trent_reznor,"@leviathant OK, I'll get you that $20 I now owe you."
trent_reznor,RT @VeronicaDLCruz: Great news! #Eric is done with his procedure and doing well!
trent_reznor,Thanks to those I got to meet this afternoon - you've begun restoring my faith in people and I needed that.  Enjoy the show!

trent_reznor,@heyericgrant here's another idea- donate and you would have met us all. Stop whining.
trent_reznor,@heyericgrant what are you bitching about?  Did you get tickets?  Did you get a pass?  Shut the fuck up already!
trent_reznor,"@VeronicaDLCruz BTW, fans have been making cool and loving cards for #ERIC - I'll be scanning / sending along!"
trent_reznor,@VeronicaDLCruz Hey - we're going to get through this with the hand we've been dealt. Stay positive!
trent_reznor,It's true - I've gone soft.  Sorry everyone.
trent_reznor,"This ""being madly in love"" thing is weird.  Feels bad being apart."
trent_reznor,"Just hung out with some cool fans, played a show that felt great and there's only one thing missing..."
trent_reznor,"@demonbaby Sorry man, I love you but that's NOT a fish.  Don't fuck with Arby's."
trent_reznor,My fundraising initiatives result in 5 more hours per day of work for them - and they're happy to do it.  Great guys.
trent_reznor,"And a word of thanks to my band: @ilanrubin, @justinmj and @robinfincktwits.  These guys are working as hard as I am to help #ERIC"

trent_reznor,I forgot Twiiter has achieved the seemingly impossible by making attention spans even shorter
trent_reznor,"We were going to announce a fundraiser offering from them and never heard back - some of you have been asking since I said ""later today""."
trent_reznor,ONCE AGAIN: EVERYTHING IS FINE WITH JA AND THE TOUR.
trent_reznor,That last message was in regards to an earlier post by me about a fundraising option they may announce.  Relax.
trent_reznor,JA went MIA today - perhaps the announcement will be tomorrow.  Or not.
trent_reznor,Jane's Addiction = @perryfarrell  @davenavarro6767 @ericavery @stephenperkins

trent_reznor,I have been assured by all parties the ticket cluster-fuck in Atlanta will never happen again.  Heads have rolled.
trent_reznor,Diddy's so far ahead of the game in so many areas it really shouldn't surprise me he's beat our system.
trent_reznor,"FYI, yes - @iamdiddy technically won again but I'm calling bullshit and disqualifying him."
trent_reznor,"Today's winners: @Aquemini03, @lothster, @primary1, @Noir_Rose and @Denbow.  Emails coming to you."

trent_reznor,"Still working on some ""intense"" challenges for tix and passes.  Talking it through with the lawyers and paramedics."
trent_reznor,"Roughly, that is."
trent_reznor,"BTW, anyone know realistically how deep one could dive without a tank and not die?"
trent_reznor,"No, we're not thinking trivia or anything like that - leaning more towards dangerous physical challenges or difficult moral choices."
trent_reznor,Rob and I are dreaming up new ways to torment you with contests...
trent_reznor,"If you're attending any NIN/JA shows, be sure to get there early to see SSSC - they kicked ass last night."
trent_reznor,"I'm not the security guy and I'm not even at the venue right now - obviously someone made an error, I'll see what I can do."
trent_reznor,People - please don't bug you-know-who about NIN business like passes and shit.  I've seen your comments and have alerted security.
trent_reznor,"I'm going to sleep myself into tomorrow, which I suspect will be a much better day.   In fact, I KNOW it will!"
trent_reznor,"NIN/JA temper tantrum #1 thrown tonight in celebration of the PA being turned off for our encore, ruining an otherwise good set."
trent_reznor,First big iPhone app test tonight!  Follow the action at our first show here:  http://bit.ly/TLKW7
trent_reznor,Apparently Diddy's fast on the draw - can't play faves.
trent_reznor,"Also, anybody aware enough to ask if they are a stalker is NOT a stalker. Does that even make sense?"
trent_reznor,"p.s. Rob LOVES creepy stalker-types, maybe you can focus on him for a while? (hint, hint)"
trent_reznor,so the next giveaway - which will happen before we go onstage today - will be from @rob_sheridan.  You know what to do.
trent_reznor,Experiment: there MAY be an issue with Twitter when you have a large following regarding the speed in which followers get messages. (cont)
