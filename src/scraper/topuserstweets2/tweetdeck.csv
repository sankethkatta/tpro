tweetdeck,"@cyberbofh fingers crossed, yes - if not then the week after"
tweetdeck,@jvboom next version of AIR? don't think it's due for a few months - best to ask Adobe

tweetdeck,@seanchoe yes there is one integrated into the next verison
tweetdeck,@chazdrums that would PWN wouldn't it :) hang in there

tweetdeck,@JayGilmore thanks for the hug Jay (yes it's Iain)
tweetdeck,"@probek sorry which ""away"" button would that be?"
tweetdeck,"@icarusforde custom column widths would destroy the readability of ""the deck"" - don't you think?"
tweetdeck,@codeblue1100 try installing/reinstalling Adobe AIR from  http://get.adobe.com/air/
tweetdeck,@tat2ts try downloading directly from here  http://bit.ly/8YIim
tweetdeck,@creatitwitty have you scrolled over to the far right? use the horizontal scrollbar at the bottom of the app
tweetdeck,"@JayGilmore multi-account TweetDeck very very soon, nearly finished"
tweetdeck,@codeblue1100 so do you have the TweetDeck_0_25.air file on your machine (as an air file)?
tweetdeck,@nutzareus username/password stored in an encrypted area on your machine
tweetdeck,@JayGilmore welcome back Jay - enjoy the testing
tweetdeck,"@codeblue1100 you should be downloading a .air file - sounds like your machine has ""unzipped"" the air file to folders...."
tweetdeck,@markveldhuis agreed
tweetdeck,"@kierandean cool, glad I could help :)"
tweetdeck,@kierandean yes - it will appear in their Replies column
tweetdeck,@ThomasDral based on the feedback - yes
tweetdeck,@Dutchiedude do you mean follow people? if so you can do that from the other actions menu on each tweet
tweetdeck,@Dutchiedude hey Dutchiedude
tweetdeck,"@BIGGC_ suggest TOTAL api % (in settings window) no higher than 85%, play with the sliders to see what works best for you"
tweetdeck,@heartofwisdom what are you searching for? is the column emtpy?
tweetdeck,@jorijnsmit shortly - there will be a separate release with a new notification system
tweetdeck,"@alffen yes - filtering will be beefed up shortly, persistent multi filters per column"
tweetdeck,@ClaudiaMulder hold that thought...
tweetdeck,@karenbyrne where are you?
tweetdeck,@codeblue1100 if you already have AIR installed you can get TweetDeck direct via  http://bit.ly/8YIim
tweetdeck,@BIGGC_ unfortunately not - limit is imposed (with good reason) by Twitter
tweetdeck,"@yogitechchick not really, what you could do is put everyone you want to ""following"" into a group, then close All Friends column"
tweetdeck,@Beregond I hear you...
tweetdeck,"@kkaazz ah that's the problem - click on the ! icon top right to log out, open TweetDeck again and enter correct twitter username/password"
tweetdeck,"@callummr which I could do user support all day but there's just so many users now its impossible for one person, not complaining obviously"
tweetdeck,"@soenarko yes, part of the fixes for the memory leak was to change how images are displayed (long story), this is a side effect"
tweetdeck,@HilzFuld also search for yourusername rather than @yourusername
tweetdeck,@fridley hold that thought...
tweetdeck,"@callummr bit over the top that warning isn't it - was more meant to warn people when they closed a group column, will get that fixed, thnks"
tweetdeck,"@patphelan thanks Pat, appreciate it"
tweetdeck,@soenarko not ideal is it - will improve that
tweetdeck,@patphelan hey pat - can you get to http://tweetdeck.com ok?
tweetdeck,"@eurodog got the impression a lot of users wr finding that ""stressful"" - knowing U have 2000 unread tweets = opening email after a holiday"
tweetdeck,@Amy_E_W yes click on the x button top right of the column will remove the column
tweetdeck,"@HilzFuld totally agree, not only does it not cost in API calls but it polls once per minute"
tweetdeck,@bitfiddler hold that thought...
tweetdeck,"@xyverz thinking there might be an issue with UK dns propagation - still can't see the site here, can't see mediatemple.net either..."
tweetdeck,"@WarrenMoney good news, thanks for letting me know"
tweetdeck,@linuxing swap over to the international font to see UTF-8 characters
tweetdeck,"@guinnessbird1 will fix that, thanks"
tweetdeck,"@poly915 you will have multi-account TweetDeck hopefully very very soon, testing parts of it now, nearly finished"
tweetdeck,"@kirtle worth increasing the rate at which the replies column polls for new tweets - found in the settings window, twitter API tab"
tweetdeck,"@TylerVideos1 bit of Adobe AIR, bit of Flex - is that what you mean?"
tweetdeck,"@BadExec awesome, thank YOU for using it :)"
tweetdeck,@MandyHowerton definitely open to ideas...ways to improve
tweetdeck,@kkaazz what the twitter status message bottom right?
tweetdeck,"@krysbia think so, will definitely add it to the list"
tweetdeck,"@cargowire in the settings tick ""show preview information for short URLs"" and get a decoded URL when you click on it"
tweetdeck,"@HilzFuld that is a great idea - only one slight problem is you won't see any tweets from protected users, no protected tweets from search"
tweetdeck,@benfrost will look into that
tweetdeck,@ILookLikeAMop have a read of this:  http://bit.ly/xJFF
tweetdeck,@WarrenMoney where abouts are you? have you cleared the browser cache?
tweetdeck,@MandyHowerton what's wrong?
tweetdeck,@kirtle are we talking about a particular column?
tweetdeck,@WarrenMoney can you see tweetdeck.com now?
tweetdeck,@SuperAffil can you not see it now? Where are you?
tweetdeck,@akulbe yep although nearly finished v0.26 :)
tweetdeck,"@MandyHowerton @kirtle ah I see, when it loads for the first time it gets 200 most recent tweets - max it can get in one api call"
tweetdeck,"@theebayk1d agreed, working on it"
tweetdeck,"@pryingEYE yes definitely, soon you'll have separate alerts for each column"
tweetdeck,@MandyHowerton are these old tweets that are missing? Any pattern?
tweetdeck,@vlcupper do you mean downloading?
tweetdeck,@MandyHowerton what updates are you missing? What is the Twitter status bottom right corner?
tweetdeck,"@hellodeibu thanks dave, appreciate it"
tweetdeck,"@MandyHowerton no, just tweetdeck.com has been moved, doesn't effect the application"
tweetdeck,@richardbarley can you download TD ok? from the download button?
tweetdeck,@jonfun definitely
tweetdeck,"@richardbarley thanks Rich - still can't see it from here, ""possible DNS propagation problems"" apparently - we'll see"
tweetdeck,"Not fun transferring tweetdeck.com to new hosting :( Should be there now for most...apologies to those affected, working on it"
tweetdeck,"@faithsonshyne do not enter your password, click on cancel to close the box (if in doubt never give away password)"
tweetdeck,"Authentication pop-up window some of you are seeing caused by Twitter rather than TweetDeck, sightings on other clients & search.twitter.com"
tweetdeck,"@Documentally @barrycarlyon on Dave channel at 9pm tonight, tomorrow, Sunday 3 new episodes"
tweetdeck,Thank-you all for the RTs - this is obviously a very fluid process...btw v0.26 expected within a week or two

tweetdeck,@techfun yes adding that to the website asap

tweetdeck,@jangles it had to be you picking me up on that :) yes it's 5pm BST
tweetdeck,@MissMarista have you tried downloading TD from tweetdeck.com recently? it includes a fix for the empty replies column
tweetdeck,@Houbsi that's for you to decide - it's not apparent right now but TweetDeck is forging a different path

tweetdeck,@proveisso cool - think there's been quite a bit of Twitter API wobbliness over the past few days

tweetdeck,@UnitedWayWells multi account is coming very soon - a huge release version coming in the next few weeks

tweetdeck,"@positiveroot TweetDeck is built on Adobe AIR so the same version runs on OS X, Windows & Linux"

tweetdeck,"@davidpritchett in the settings window, twitter api tab"
tweetdeck,@Texskiss that message is direct from twitter unfortunately - might be worth changing your password at twitter.com & then see if that works
tweetdeck,@Bianca257 have you previously sent me your TweetDeck database via email?
tweetdeck,@1earth2love certainly am :)
tweetdeck,"@swelfy I think that's my point 80 tweets now, how much will that be effected when biggest twitter userbase comes online, is the gap closing"
tweetdeck,@themil the group selection process is undergoing a big overhaul will be available shortly
tweetdeck,@davidpritchett yes updates will be coming thick and fast
tweetdeck,@rvwhalen good morning East Coast
tweetdeck,@JosephHug exactly - wasn't long ago that at the same time with slightly less following that figure was considerably lower
tweetdeck,@talesin I bow down to your superiority :)
tweetdeck,@davidpritchett the UK
tweetdeck,@khorre that's what I'm getting at will be interesting to see if that rate shoots up over the coming hours
tweetdeck,@themil :) well I'm following them so it's not a reflection on my popularity is it
tweetdeck,@andrewmid if your window is hiden then right-click system tray icon and select reset window
tweetdeck,"Interesting, I'm following 15,000 people and getting 80 tweets a minute whilst the US sleeps"

tweetdeck,"@gpok leave it with me, I'll look into this further"
tweetdeck,"@Texskiss click on the ! icon top right to reset the login details stored in TD, then reopen and you'll see a login form"
tweetdeck,"@gpok cool, how would this relate to TweetDeck?"
tweetdeck,@Texskiss it means twitter thinks your username/password is not correct - have you changed it recently?
tweetdeck,"@Bianca257 first thing to try - remove the replies column, then add it back in again from the replies icon at the top"
tweetdeck,@CountryDiscount nice quote #quote
tweetdeck,@benoitx http://bit.ly/zpKPm

tweetdeck,@AlanEdinger you can follow someone when looking at their profile or in the other actions button on the avatar rollover
tweetdeck,@faseidl yep fixing that now
tweetdeck,@dustinbrewer if it was working fine then suddenly stopped working with no changes to TweetDeck then I'd guess that's an API thing
tweetdeck,@philcampbell do you still need me to take a look at your TD database?
tweetdeck,@vielmetti nice - what event was this? #LA2M
tweetdeck,"@glenstansberry that is in development, won't be long"
tweetdeck,@sbostedor nice idea

tweetdeck,"@hubbit hi, nice tweet :) thanks for the support, really appreciate it"
tweetdeck,@krisguy yes coming very soon
tweetdeck,@robincapper you can increase the button brightness in the settings menu
tweetdeck,@spencerlindsay sounds like an API blip - twitter.com does not use the API which explains the difference
tweetdeck,@danpatmore they control how often TweetDeck polls the twitter API for updates - more info on API here http://bit.ly/xJFF
tweetdeck,"@bews yes working on the memory usage, will be fixed shortly - in the meantime restart the app occasionally to free up the memory"
tweetdeck,@webaddict that will be happening very shortly #TweetDeck
tweetdeck,"RT @rachelbabble: @scheffxp @tweetdeck changed the way I use Twitter, and for that matter, the Internet. - awesome! glad I can help :)"
tweetdeck,"@timhaines I'm up with the larks...never liked larks though, far too chirpy"
tweetdeck,@Bianca257 do you have some time to try something?
tweetdeck,"@bkGirlFriday no - tell me again, I like it"
tweetdeck,@jklang there's been no change to TweetDeck so if they were showing up before but suddenly aren't now then I'm guessing a blip in the API
tweetdeck,@ryeseronie you'll be doing that soon
tweetdeck,@bswain absolutely
tweetdeck,"@doson don't think it's specific to TD, since the image URLs are provided via the twitter API"
tweetdeck,@Vlek very soon you'll have unlimited columns - there is a lot going on right now to take TweetDeck to the next level
tweetdeck,"@ivanbrezakbrkan chances are always good, everything proposed is considered - first thing to do would be to add it to  http://bit.ly/RjfK"
tweetdeck,@TheGimliGlider @TerryFree @marcec @icarusforde @traceyhand @mdanbom good morning and thank-you
tweetdeck,@bswain ah if only it were down to me I'd give you 000's per hour - the API limit comes from Twitter
tweetdeck,@alexanderhorre @ryanfife thanks

tweetdeck,@Japh didn't show up very well in the default TweetDeck colours
tweetdeck,"@magnetite no not an experiment, but you're right I am gorgeous - from an avian perspective"
tweetdeck,"@richardBarley madness - so much to do before tomorrow, could be an all nighter tonight"
tweetdeck,I bet uploading another avatar so quickly takes longer to show up via the API...
tweetdeck,@richardBarley looks like something went wrong yesterday with avatars
tweetdeck,@scheffxp no that's new - you can select the greyness in the settings panel
tweetdeck,Although my avatar needs a background...
tweetdeck,Anyone having issues with avatar not showing up - looks like uploading your image again does the trick
tweetdeck,"Ok, image now appears on twitter.com - just got to wait for it to filter through the API"
tweetdeck,hmmm my avatar is not showing up...uploading image again
tweetdeck,Morning/evening all
tweetdeck,"RT @richardbarley: Morning everyone! I updated ""All Your TweetDeck Questions Answered"" last night with 3 big new FAQs. http://cli.gs/tdfaqs"
tweetdeck,"@dollars5 that will be fixed shortly, group creation is getting a big overhaul"
tweetdeck,@dollars5 social graph api only provides user id not screen name
tweetdeck,@PhilReinhardt what error are you getting?
tweetdeck,"API issue update: not seeing any more 404 (not found), everything updating ok, api count correct - anyone still having update issues?"
tweetdeck,@timstaines twitter auto shortens some URLs - nothing to do with TweetDeck
tweetdeck,@mcmama have a look through my recent tweets to find out what's going on
tweetdeck,"@m_scott have a look through my recent tweets regarding this issue, it's API based"
tweetdeck,"@ScottH_UK all good - no need to apologise, twitter are on the case"
tweetdeck,"@DarkByteMX @gothick thanks for confirming it's not just TD, appears to be effecting those clients which use the since_id parameter"
tweetdeck,@swang no probs - trying to keep everyone as up to date as possible
tweetdeck,"@Silenceofus interesting so you are seeing ""not found error"" on other apps - as I figured"
tweetdeck,@philmuc I'm running TweetDeck in debug and am catching numerous 404 responses
tweetdeck,"@tollie yes - there will be a ""ungrouped"" column soon"
tweetdeck,"@ActivityGrrrl thanks, appreciate your tweet"
tweetdeck,"@erikwolf i think so, have a read of my most recent tweets"

tweetdeck,"@GrantGriffiths hi Grant, have a quick read through my previous tweets"
tweetdeck,@ThomasDral hi Thomas yes there are - have a read through my recent tweets
tweetdeck,@jeanpaulh ha ha nice - I can grovel if that helps?
tweetdeck,"@Polledemaagt firefighting right now, still investigating"
tweetdeck,@mzsanford yes matt will do...thanks for getting in touch (all to do with since_id parameter)
tweetdeck,@jasonbynum don't think this has anything to do with AIR
tweetdeck,"@frumpa no probs, doesn't seem to be related to a specific TD version"
tweetdeck,@Polledemaagt still investigating but guessing they may not be using this type of api method
tweetdeck,@ScottH_UK it's not an AIR related issue
tweetdeck,So how did you spend your Friday night...
tweetdeck,Could illustrate the problem in a browser (i.e. non TD related) but fear that might exacerbate the problem if everyone hits the api together
tweetdeck,@jeanpaulh I am very much hoping so :-(
tweetdeck,"@spike72 yes definitely, this actually has the effect of pointing out which clients use these calls and which don't"
tweetdeck,@phraktyl :-)
tweetdeck,"@dmachiavello that is a different issue, one which has seen significant progress in the past few days, more on that very soon"
tweetdeck,"This issue does not appear to be related to the new version of AIR which was released around the same time, an unfortunate coincidence"
tweetdeck,"Since your TweetDeck has not been updated in the past few days and was updating fine, this would suggest this is not TD bug related"
tweetdeck,"When you first start up TweetDeck, the API calls in question are not required and hence why everything loads as it should"
tweetdeck,"Continuing to investigate, you may see similar behavior in other clients that use these type of API calls"
tweetdeck,"It appears that a certain type of call to the Twitter API is intermittently returning a 404 (not found), thus causing TD to stop updating"
tweetdeck,"Ok morning/afternoon/evening all, have news on the current problems effecting TweetDeck..."
tweetdeck,"@pprlisa click on the ! icon top right to sign out of current twitter account, restart and then you'll see a login form"

tweetdeck,"@erikmagraken she is lovely isn't she, we went to school together, she never knew I existed, tragic really"
tweetdeck,@CourtneyEngle that is something I could add - worth adding it to http://tweetdeck.uservoice.com #twitterhelp

tweetdeck,"@iamkhayyam you do look happy, not sure what you're looking at though"
tweetdeck,I'm thinking with the increased TweetDeck userbase it's going to be easy to support via email rather than twitter - gives me full history

tweetdeck,@Hasteur yep - not seeing it myself yet but getting reports of things slowing down
tweetdeck,@JohnRidgeway totally with you there - monitoring how twitter & other services cope with this will be very useful

tweetdeck,@rhussmann yes there is additional TD-specific logic
tweetdeck,@Hsilamot @bhavishya the Twitter API sometimes provides incorrect follow/unfollow data which leads to the wrong button being displayed
tweetdeck,"@just_kate hi, the SHIFT+SPACE thing is an AIR bug rather than a TweetDeck one, I'm sure Adobe will have a fix out for that soon"

tweetdeck,@GamePlanHayden yep
tweetdeck,@toddcrawford it's all gone horribly wrong with the twitter API - we just have to sit it out and rely on search results

tweetdeck,@aristippus303 it doesn't throw any away BUT when you restart the app it will get a max of 200 tweets and start collecting again

tweetdeck,@girlonetrack do you have other apps open which use your twitter username/password? desktop/mobile/blog/facebook
