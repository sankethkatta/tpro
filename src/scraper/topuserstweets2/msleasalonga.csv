msleasalonga,@mistermiranda Oh I wasn't being harassed tonight. But I think I might be tomorrow. Just another day at the office.

msleasalonga,@riaroxas Nor does she say she can.
msleasalonga,@riaroxas I don't know why TV5 drew that conclusion. But an assumption was made. There you go.
msleasalonga,@riaroxas Truth is I said Anne says herself she isn't a singer so I can't be angry with her. She made a dream come true and I respect that.
msleasalonga,"@kokogatsu It's frustrating, is what it is. Chances are I would've been one of the under-appreciated if not for Miss Saigon."
msleasalonga,"@iheartBleu The question was, ""What's your opinion on people who sing out of tune?"" I answered honestly. This has been going on a long time."
msleasalonga,@kokogatsu Oh but I have. Of course. I have learned to expect It.
msleasalonga,"That is what burns me, and is insulting to all singer-craftsmen, gifted artists that work so hard and need to be heard and patronized."
msleasalonga,"There are people calling themselves singers without the talent to justify it, taking away business from those that rightly deserve it."
msleasalonga,"So before anyone decides to launch an attack because of what I said, which I stand by, find out exactly what I said in full, and in context."
msleasalonga,...but I have strong opinions about off-key singers. Anne herself doesn't identify as a singer. I respect that and said so today.
msleasalonga,A full transcript of an interview answer I gave today has just been posted. I didn't diss or attack @annecurtissmith directly...
