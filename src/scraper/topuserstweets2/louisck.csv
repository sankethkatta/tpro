louisck,"@kiposevi  I do get it, mister egg surrounded by orange.  I just have an additional thing to say that isn't exactly the same."
louisck,@theharryshearer I don't think I've ever dribbled a pearl.  I am often disgusting on stage.  Beyond wrong.  and not always funny.
louisck,@theharryshearer Absolutely.  And the explosion itself is an educational result.  Not a failure.
louisck,@theharryshearer Lenny had a bit about DH Lawrence vs. porn mags.  saying that the porn guy goes to jail for poor writing skill.
louisck,@theharryshearer Harry.  I think you are the apex of where funny and smart meet.  I'd love to discuss this with you further.
louisck,I guess I felt like I was hearing just the one thing about this over and over again.  I just said something different.
louisck,here's what I think is great.  Folks are talking.  It's stimulating and it opens doors.
louisck,"@theharryshearer I laughed at Lenny too.  But if I didn't, it's still comedy.  It's a pretty tricky chemistry experiment."
louisck,@theharryshearer I did at some of it.  yes.  Not at all of it.
louisck,"I would love to say I was wrong, because that means I've grown.  I don't feel that yet, but I'm listening."
louisck,this whole thing has been a fascinating learning experience. @tanehisi wrote a great piece that I don't completely agree with.
louisck,"@theharryshearer all of these words, including funny, need a ""to"" and then a subject afterwards, don't they?"
louisck,@theharryshearer @MiltShook yes it can.  Often.  and kind simultaneously.  But sometimes just cruel.
louisck,@theharryshearer Okay. Funny.  Can I have another one?
louisck,@theharryshearer  I'd say the distinction is comedy vs. political statements.  Is there no distinction there in your mind?
louisck,@rogerbinion nothing unless he farts as you stab him and has fudge all over his fat little face.  dude no one stabbed anyone.
louisck,RT @rogerbinion: @louisck What exactly is 'hilarious' about stabbing a child? Just wondering.
louisck,okay now really that's all.  Unless I think of something else.
louisck,It is clear to anyone with an ability to reason and understand people that he didn't mean a word of what he said.  he was fucking around.
