professorgreen,"noooooooo she's older. RT @KilnerLUFC: @professorgreen @swindleuk Case of being there, done it, then?"
professorgreen,@Lauren_Bolger_ you can write about a loss you haven't experienced using the feelings from one you have.

professorgreen,"@GreenLightAnna incorrect - its all unisex. millie has the varsity, some tees and a tracksuit."
professorgreen,my cleaner is in the middle of doing my room though so i basically have no bed to nap on. back to condensing my wardrobe...
professorgreen,feel like the need for a nap is coming on.
professorgreen,"@SonnyAnnesley I'm white, I tend to look, ya know, white. I don't spend my life on sunbeds - men who do have issues."
professorgreen,@shortymcsquare i think unless someone has had health problems then there really is no need... women should feel good as they are
professorgreen,@jessie_ware If a man sung 'something inside' it would be much less sentimental.
professorgreen,@_LeeM_ yea its cheap and tacky - not a fan
professorgreen,@jennyhiggins well they're both essentially the same thing
professorgreen,"@rakey1990 no, i bank with lloyds - and my account has never seen a million"
professorgreen,@DuckHead1992 if this were true i wouldn't be separating my laundry from my dry cleaning right now

professorgreen,when does the snow start?
professorgreen,windermere is sounding like the best bet
professorgreen,he obviously missed the part where i was asking which area within the lake district i should stay in as i've never been... GIMP
professorgreen,people are so dumb... apparently i should use google and i'm just a popstar used to having everything done for me
professorgreen,RT @frankieboyle: Justin Lee Collins has been given 140 hours of unpaid work. The best offer his agent will get him in the next five years.

professorgreen,piss me off when these*
professorgreen,none of these magazines wanna meet me when i'm truly pissed off. believe that.
professorgreen,essentially trying to alter peoples perception of me and making me out a cunt when the honesty of it is...
professorgreen,it does however piss me off when this dogshite 'publications' mention nothing of the trolls i have to put up with when they report about it.
professorgreen,If i want to reply to cretins that say horrible things to me with equally as horrible but much funnier things it doesn't make me evil
professorgreen,LOL @ Look Magazine trying to get Millie to comment on my tweets - muppets.

professorgreen,@Popjustice sound dreadful. i could never be that self indulgent.
professorgreen,@gemmalouisa1 they change throughout the day
