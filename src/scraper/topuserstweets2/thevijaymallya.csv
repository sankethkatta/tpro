thevijaymallya,As an MP I am happy 2 b included in any Lokpal Bill that may b passed I also firmly believe that PM must b excluded as it demeans his office
thevijaymallya,Amazing how politics work. Several MP's across party lines agree that FDI in retail is good but are compelled to object to tow party lines
thevijaymallya,FDI in retail is great. It is a proven model globally. Why do v ignore that upto 40% of farm produce is wasted due to lack of infrastructure

thevijaymallya,"If our Government has denied FDI by Airlines in Indian carriers on security grounds, how come we have expat non Indian Airline CEO's ?"
thevijaymallya,Spice CEO's comment that Kingfisher should not b bailed out ? What bail out? He should focus on his own Country and not give advise in India
thevijaymallya,Watching media reports n analysis that share prices of United Spirits fell due to Airline fears. How flawed. United Spirits is liquid gold
thevijaymallya,My Airline competitors assume their own financial viability based on the demise of Kingfisher And they are doing everything Crazy Industry.

thevijaymallya,Times Now and its unique anchor Arnab Goswami questions why Government should bail out Kingfisher. Kingfisher never asked for a Bail out.
thevijaymallya,Times of India reported that Banks denied a Kingfisher Loan restructuring request. Kingfisher never made any such request.
