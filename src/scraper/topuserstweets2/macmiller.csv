macmiller,It's all love tho. I ain't even mad at dude. He still a legend.
macmiller,"I did nothing wrong. We spoke on the phone had a good conversation, he was cool with the record."
macmiller,5. Finesse never cleared the Oscar Peterson sample on the original record.
macmiller,3. All I wanted to do is shed light on a generation that inspired me
macmiller,2. Finesse and I spoke on the phone for an hour after he heard the record and cleared the air. We even planned to work on music together
macmiller,"1. I made that record and video as nothing more than an 18 year old kid who wanted to rhyme and pay homage, no other intentions."
