veronica,@AblativMeatshld you sure are responding a lot to someone whos not worth it! goodnight!
veronica,"@AblativMeatshld you really dont need to be this angry. things got a bit heated, but we all had strong opinions. I can agree to disagree."
veronica,"@BadMesmer whats your show about? Id be happy to be on sometime, though I dont think your friend likes me much!"
veronica,"@Ashayo thats probably a coincidence, but funny nonetheless!"
veronica,"@Satyr607 I know! Also, I need to know what a #bunkerslut is. Going to bed now though :)"
veronica,@BadMesmer thanks!!
veronica,"@Satyr607 thanks, its been a long night, but ultimately good I hope!"
veronica,"@BadMesmer @Beregond @gregb94 @AblativMeatshld hah! not at all politically motivated! lets not bring that onto the table, Im exhausted."
veronica,"@sunscreen I try not to get mad this often, I have to watch my blood pressure ;)"
veronica,"@Satyr607 its ok, theres a lot of text to go through!"
veronica,@Satyr607 go back and read me timeline #lazy
veronica,"Male or female, there needs to be some accountability. I got heated tonight, &amp; thats not the best method. But a discussion is good."
veronica,"I dont like giving attention to trolls either, but its time we stop letting assholes slip under the radar. Stand up for your own, people."
veronica,"@MitchyD @lizziecuevas nothing to see, move along! :)"
veronica,@Bloodedfury @hiphopgamer @CheapyD @Shipwreck I keep hoping that one day the shit you make up will become true! ;)
veronica,@MattDogKiller I pulled the @destructoid folks in because I respect their community and think theyre better than that one voice.
veronica,@KevinKeefe thanks man!
veronica,@Desroth I need to make a follow-up video for the book!
veronica,"@zebular0 I call it like I see it. If the dude didnt want to make it public, then he shouldnt have included her Twitter handle."
veronica,@Esko a good key-lime will do that to ya!
veronica,@Dreyesbo thanks!! :)
veronica,"@mikeyface lime, not line #damnyouautocorrect"
veronica,@mikeyface is there any other way to eat key line pie? ;)
veronica,@mikeyface haha! mostly Im just eating key lime pie: http://t.co/CxlO8CJx
veronica,@whatisthisusaid no worries!
veronica,"@feliciaday hey, I kind of started it :) been a while since I started some shit on the Internet, all for a good cause!"
veronica,"@whatisthisusaid I cant even tell who youre talking about now. But as I said, if Im a dick/bitch for defending my friend, Ill take it."
veronica,@NJShadow @TheKevinDent @davidscottjaffe you are all welcome anytime! :)
veronica,@whatisthisusaid are we not allowed to have an opinion about that opinion?
veronica,@mitchellcmiller hah!!
veronica,@dancraggs @wilw and we have every right to respond to it. :)
veronica,@davidscottjaffe @mattmccullar @Vaughn_Johnson @feliciaday  have to be treated that way.
veronica,"@davidscottjaffe @mattmccullar @Vaughn_Johnson @feliciaday Im not really sure when sexism jumped in, but Im glad we agree no one should"
veronica,"@Bryce_Schoening dude, @paulandstorm send those to everyone all the time. Been there seen that!!"
veronica,"@davidscottjaffe but I will say that in a male dominated industry, women have to work and fight a little harder. Is that arguable?"
veronica,@davidscottjaffe @mattmccullar @Vaughn_Johnson  then they are also idiots. and Im sure people spoke up for them too.
veronica,@davidscottjaffe @mattmccullar @Vaughn_Johnson @feliciaday if anyone has ever argued that those men have not contributed to gaming culture..
veronica,@Sinnyd and whats wrong with that exactly? We celebrate sexuality on #VaginalFantasy and hope to bring that discussion more into the open.
veronica,"@Vaughn_Johnson @davidscottjaffe @mattmccullar but, I think a discussion of these gender issues is important, so good on you."
veronica,@Vaughn_Johnson @davidscottjaffe @mattmccullar gender wasnt the issue here in my mind. It was just pure douchbaggery.
veronica,"@davidscottjaffe @Vaughn_Johnson if any of my guy friends were subject to that kind of abuse, I would do the exact same thing."
veronica,@AblativMeatshld so youre calling me a bitch for sticking up for my friend. OK. Cool.
veronica,"@jcrizzle I have absolutely no problem with @Dtoid or even @destructoid, I just wanted to highlight this contributor who was way out of line"
veronica,@AblativMeatshld so why are we arguing exactly?
veronica,@Vaughn_Johnson @davidscottjaffe thats fair. but whats happening right now is people sticking up for their friend. its personal.
veronica,@AblativMeatshld and Im saying is that it would take an idiot to not see what shes contributed.
veronica,@davidscottjaffe I have no idea what youre trying to say right now.
veronica,"@AblativMeatshld and if he (or anyone) thinks he can be an asshole for no reason on the Internet to someone, then expect repercussions."
veronica,"@AblativMeatshld he can have an opinion. So can I. Shes my friend, and I dont think I need to cite sources to show what shes contributed."
veronica,OH: Its the apocalypse! Were already bartering our virginity for alcohol anyway! via @lizlet
veronica,"@duhproject he can say what he wants, and so can I."
veronica,"@AblativMeatshld its a mean venomous thing to say, and Im allowed to comment on it too. Thats the Internet for ya!"
