annecurtissmith,@teddyboylocsin he already made me a peace ambassador. So it's my duty to make a stand when it goes exactly what we're aiming for.
annecurtissmith,"I'm afraid will do the complete opposite. 

I am for the Revision of the Cybercrime Act."
annecurtissmith,An act that takes away a citizen's freedom &amp; right to hear/read/tweet/retweet/blog/post/like about the good &amp; bad things about our country
annecurtissmith,"We want peace in our country, amongst our people &amp; future generations."
annecurtissmith,&amp; we should all have equal rights. I just feel its so one sided. I hope they consider REVISING  the crybercrime act.
annecurtissmith,Even if I know that as a celebrity I'd probably even benefit from the act but at the end of the day i'm still a citizen of this country
annecurtissmith,BUT going to extent of having a law that takes away a freedom we should all rightfully have just seems wrong to me.
annecurtissmith,The cybercrime act does have some responsible points that should be included &amp; implemented BUT
annecurtissmith,And now if we share our opinions we can get into trouble with the law? Put behind bars? Fined a ridiculous amount even?
annecurtissmith,Whatever happened to Freedom of speech? Having an opinion? Expressing oneself? These are our own accounts. Our property. Our lives.
annecurtissmith,Being someone thats active in the Social Media world I couldn't help but feel sad &amp; scared while reading the Cybercrime Act.
