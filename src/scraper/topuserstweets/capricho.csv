CAPRICHO,"Leta while watching a video of herself: ""That girl is crazy!"""
CAPRICHO,"Jon last night after a nasty bout of absentmindedness: ""Do you know how frustrating it is to be me? DO YOU?"""
CAPRICHO,"Leta: ""Dad, did you buy our house at Costco?"""
CAPRICHO,Listening to Destroyer and cleaning out the refrigerator. An ideal Saturday morning.
CAPRICHO,The only way to teach Leta about diversity in Utah is by taking her to the liquor store.
CAPRICHO,Either these pants shrunk in the wash or I suddenly grew a butt.
CAPRICHO,"Leta's latest attempt at an insult: ""I'm not caring about you!"""
CAPRICHO,First day of the year with temperatures in the 70s and people are walking around in bikinis.
CAPRICHO,Mormon-owned newspaper coming over to the house. Better hide my collection of Noam Chomsky.
CAPRICHO,"Apparently, a whole bunch of angry Mormons read the Wall Street Journal."
CAPRICHO,Two WHAM! songs in a row! I totally want to uhhook this radio station's bra strap.
CAPRICHO,Google maps just told me to take the exit toward Mecca.
CAPRICHO,"First pedicure in four years, and it is hhhaaawwwsome."
CAPRICHO,I don't think anyone in Palm Springs has ever heard of sunscreen.
CAPRICHO,"The 80-yr-old man on the treadmill next to mine was running twice as fast as I was, but I win because I had cuter shoes."
CAPRICHO,oh damn.
CAPRICHO,OH MY GOD. Memphis. MEMPHIS!
CAPRICHO,GO MEMPHIS!
CAPRICHO,"I had on SPF 70 today, and I still got sun. THERE IS NO SOLUTION."
CAPRICHO,"You want to see me call the police? Park your car in the sun with the windows rolled up, 80 degrees, your 3-month old puppy in the front ..."
CAPRICHO,I have never been so thrilled to hear the low hum of a lawn mower.
CAPRICHO,"Sat 2 rows behind Rick Springfield on our flight, resisted urge to run up and stick my tongue in his eye."
CAPRICHO,Headed to Palm Springs. Forecast says mid-80s all week. May not be using the return ticket.
CAPRICHO,"Jon: There is a huge Chinese population in China. Me: Who would  have guessed! Jon: I mean, San Francisco, oh shut up MISS CRAYOLA CROWN."
CAPRICHO,I didn't want to but they forced me to say poop on live TV. I can feel Maggie gagging from here.
CAPRICHO,"Hoping I can sneak out of the house quietly enough that Bo doesn't hear me, ROO! unexpectedly and wake Jon up with a seizure. Tippy-toes!"
CAPRICHO,"Tomorrow morning I'm going to be on the local news, and I can't decide whether or not I should wear any pants."
CAPRICHO,"If you're not delighting in the fact that everything is staged, then you're missing the whole point of reality programming."
CAPRICHO,You go right ahead and exercise your demons. But you might want to take it a step further and ask them to cut back on carbs.
CAPRICHO,"To answer your question, no, I do not think that a dog who poops in a moving vehicle is a _smart_ animal."
CAPRICHO,"Leta: ""Mom? When we get to the library can I take my pants off?"""
CAPRICHO,My sister's Beagle Bo is staying with us for the next week. Jon has already started drinking. Motor oil.
CAPRICHO,It wouldn't surprise me to find out that Jesus has used the words CARPET MUNCHER in a text to his friends.
CAPRICHO,"Woke up yo 6 inches of snow on the ground, and Coco was so excited about it that I took out a gun and shot her."
CAPRICHO,"Leta: ""Cinderella loves her prince."" What I heard: Cinderella loves herpes. All this time I thought she preferred syphilis."
CAPRICHO,"When my mother asks Leta if she wants to go to church, we're teaching Leta to say, ""Don't pitch me, bro."""
CAPRICHO,"Salad past its sell by date, Jon wants to determine if he can still eat it, walks up to me and says, ""I need you to smell something for me."""
CAPRICHO,"Made too much of a fuss over Leta's hair because she suddenly stomped into her room, slammed the door and yelled UGH! I NEED SOME SPACE!"
CAPRICHO,The ring tone on my iPhone is set to the sound of a dog barking to signal when Jon is calling. Coco does not appreciate this feature.
CAPRICHO,Leta: How many do I have to eat? Me: 10. Leta: How about 8? Me: 10. Leta: How about 5? Me: You're going in the wrong direction.
CAPRICHO,Listening to Kevin Rose being interviewed on NPR. Getting SO WET. In my armpits.
CAPRICHO,Was unable to escape Ikea without buying the LORDUNSTUKKAFINSTRA. That one gets me every time.
CAPRICHO,"""So I said, 'That is so stupid! How OLD are you?'"" Leta from the other room: I'M FOURRRR!"
CAPRICHO,"Jon watched The Hills with me last night, and then we both took a hot shower so that we would feel better about ourselves. Didn't work."
CAPRICHO,"GEORGE!: playing basketball in the backyard, me: not informing him that Chuck pees on that basketball every morning. Le oops!"
CAPRICHO,"Leta looked at the hot fudge sundae we had at lunch, pointed to the vanilla ice cream and said, ""Can you get rid of that white stuff?"""
CAPRICHO,My mother believes that global warming is a hoax. And now I'm afraid to ask her whether or not she believes the Earth is round.
CAPRICHO,"Leta, having just dropped a Fruit Loop on the floor: ""Oh my goodness stakes!"""
CAPRICHO,"Last night I dreamt that I tweeted, ""I just have a thing for globes."" And got hundreds of responses that said, ""SO DO I!"""
CAPRICHO,"GEORGE! has Ace of Base in his iTunes, so I checked his luggage and his balls were sealed inside a Ziploc right there under his panties."
CAPRICHO,Chuck is now growling at the fireplace. Definitely code for: TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY.
CAPRICHO,"GEORGE!: ""STOP LICKING ME, COCO!"" That is all he's said since he walked in the door seven hours ago."
CAPRICHO,GEORGE! is visiting for the next five days. Not looking forward to his nightly 4 AM stomping march to the bathroom.
CAPRICHO,"Another long night of Leta's spider legs kicking me in the face, and now the bags under my eyes are threatening to annex the rest of my head"
CAPRICHO,"Four-layer celebratory casserole: refried beans, mashed potatoes, cheese, and finally a thick topping of crushed Fritos."
CAPRICHO,"Why you should never make assumptions: ""Why did you draw a picture of George Bush?"" ""That's not George Bush, that's Prince Charming."""
CAPRICHO,"Who downloaded TLC's ""Creep"" onto the computer in the kitchen? I want  you to come over to my house right now and let me braid your hair."
CAPRICHO,"""Remove outer wrap before popping."" I want to sit down and have a beer with the person who needs to be told this specific direction."
CAPRICHO,Manuscript finished. That bottle of bourbon in our liquor cabinet should be very afraid.
CAPRICHO,Coco is now barking at the snow as it falls off the trees. I'm wondering if there is a clause in her warranty about this.
CAPRICHO,How many things can you think of doing other than writing the manuscript that is due in two days? THOUSANDS. THOUSANDS.
CAPRICHO,My immediate family is taking six separate cars to dinner. Because seven would have been too excessive.
CAPRICHO,It's snowing. And am I going to complain about it? No. Not at all. I would never do that. BUT I MIGHT STOMP MY FEET.
CAPRICHO,Coco is barking at the rain.
CAPRICHO,"Guy in car with SEXYBOY license plate just pulled into the drive-thru at Arby's. Utah, sometimes I want to kiss you on the mouth."
CAPRICHO,"Both dogs and Jon asleep on the couch, Leta running around the living room without any pants on. Would rather be nowhere else."
CAPRICHO,Leta looks like she grew four inches taller.
CAPRICHO,Exit row! Exit row! I feel like I just won a round of bingo.
CAPRICHO,"Early, early morning. Headed home. Goodbye, Austin! You are awesome."
CAPRICHO,Major hamburger hangover.
CAPRICHO,Acting very civilized.
CAPRICHO,4 glasses of champagne and FINALLY BUZZED WOOOO
CAPRICHO,Love ruins EVERYTHING!
CAPRICHO,"Speaking on a panel, 3:30, floor 3, room 8. Come say hi!"
CAPRICHO,Time for some champagne!
CAPRICHO,GOING TO THROW UP NOW
CAPRICHO,Menu reads: retried beans made with bacon. I know who's catering my funeral!
CAPRICHO,Where is Mike Montiero?
CAPRICHO,"It's not even 9:30 pm and I'm gonna fall over, HOW MORMON IS THAT?"
CAPRICHO,Jon is getting nervous for his panel and it is so cute.

CAPRICHO,Decorating the tree! 18-month-old totally baffled by giant tree that has appeared in our living room.
CAPRICHO,"Arrived 50 minutes early at JFK on flight back from SFO, thanks to massive tailwinds. When has that ever happened before?"

CAPRICHO,Finally found a reason to be excited about Leopard: the Mosaic screensaver. Awesome party trick--like showing Keyhole for the first time.
CAPRICHO,"Bee Movie with the kids. Nice to see they didn't make the Queen a leader, as in Antz and Bug's Life. Seinfeld clearly an Emergence fan."
CAPRICHO,"My little essay on why hyperlocal is hard, and why it's worth doing:
http://tinyurl.com/ynroc2"
CAPRICHO,Just saw an original of John Snow's Broad Street map at the Field Museum in Chicago. Second time I've seen it live.
CAPRICHO,Someone should invent a Lego vacuum cleaner. Just picked up maybe six thousand pieces by hand. Much easier to vacuum directly into the box.
CAPRICHO,On the plane flying back to NYC. 11 straight days away --all time record post-kids. Cannot wait to get back.
CAPRICHO,Somehow missed the gmail web app for the iPhone. Much better and faster than the built-in Mail app.
CAPRICHO,Overheard at breakfast at posh London hotel: two banker types in their late fifties talking about doing their pilates.
CAPRICHO,Going through security without having to take your shoes off makes the whole thing seem much less stressful somehow.
CAPRICHO,Powering through my email queue on the iPhone while sitting in a hammock by the sea. Or is that the kind of thing best kept to yourself?
CAPRICHO,"This is Barcelona: narrow, twisted, medieval pedestrian streets -- and then you hit the new harbor and it's like: hello, San Diego!"
CAPRICHO,"Wow, already have 44 followers. How come every single one of them is a dude? That's scary."

CAPRICHO,Trying my first mobile twittering -- from an outdoor cafe in the Barri Gotic in Barcelona. All downhill from here.
CAPRICHO,"Hello, Twitter. I come in peace for all mankind."
