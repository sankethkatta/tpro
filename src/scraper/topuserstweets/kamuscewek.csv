KamusCewek,Back with a trainer at the gym for the first time in like eight years. My core is pretty much hollow.
KamusCewek,"Today with the kids: Super Mario Galaxy on the Wii, The Lion King on Broadway, then Planet Earth in HD-DVD. Our interests perfectly aligned."
KamusCewek,"Just realized 2007 was the first year in five years that I failed to write a book, start a company, or have a kid. Slacker!"
KamusCewek,"If they had made a Christmas-present-wrapping test part of the SATs, I literally wouldn't have gone to college. I am beyond awful at it."
KamusCewek,Happy winter solstice all you northern hemispherans. It only gets brighter from here!

KamusCewek,Decorating the tree! 18-month-old totally baffled by giant tree that has appeared in our living room.
KamusCewek,"Arrived 50 minutes early at JFK on flight back from SFO, thanks to massive tailwinds. When has that ever happened before?"

KamusCewek,Trying hard to not be outraged that the new SimCity has done away with zoning.
KamusCewek,Finally found a reason to be excited about Leopard: the Mosaic screensaver. Awesome party trick--like showing Keyhole for the first time.
KamusCewek,"Bee Movie with the kids. Nice to see they didn't make the Queen a leader, as in Antz and Bug's Life. Seinfeld clearly an Emergence fan."

KamusCewek,Just saw an original of John Snow's Broad Street map at the Field Museum in Chicago. Second time I've seen it live.
KamusCewek,Someone should invent a Lego vacuum cleaner. Just picked up maybe six thousand pieces by hand. Much easier to vacuum directly into the box.
KamusCewek,On the plane flying back to NYC. 11 straight days away --all time record post-kids. Cannot wait to get back.

KamusCewek,"Dining in Barcelona. Everyone speaking German, Russian, French but lingua franca with waiters: English. Yes! All your base are belong to us!"

KamusCewek,"Hello, Twitter. I come in peace for all mankind."
