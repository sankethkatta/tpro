JohnDonvan,More of your fantastic Tweetales are in my Favorites bin.  Hopefully they're all getting in there.  But I definitely put them all in.
JohnDonvan,Now Tweetales from 12 hours ago are appearing but others are disappearing.  Wonder if it just randomly selects favs.  It's screwy.
JohnDonvan,Is there a limit to the number of favorites I can save?  I marked everybody's Tweetale but anything older than 5 hours ago didn't post.
JohnDonvan,I marked everyone's story so far as a favorite.  So see if you can read them that way.  I think it'll work.
