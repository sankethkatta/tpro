ciara,"It would be a great help if everyone could retweet and get the word out that we've made the server move successfully, thanks everyone!"
ciara,"If you are seeing the ""We've completed our server move"" page then this means the DNS changes haven't updated in your area yet, hang tight"
ciara,We're bringing mobile posting back online soon. Some mobile uploads may have not made it to our servers during the move
ciara,"Some of you may still be seeing the ""old"" server, this just means the DNS changes haven't made it to your area yet"
ciara,"For those of you having issues connecting to twitpic, they have been resolved"
ciara,We've completed our server move. We are just waiting on the DNS update to propagate across the internet.
ciara,We're moving servers! We will be back up later depending on how fast the DNS propagates.
