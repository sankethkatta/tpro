ErinAndrews,Why does the server always ask if you are enjoying your meal when you're right in the middle of chewing something?
ErinAndrews,"Leta is in our office playing computer games, and Chuck, World's Most Stoic Dog, is in there by her side making sure she's okay."
ErinAndrews,"My boobs have never been this big, and I never thought I'd say this, but my God, could they be more obnoxious?"

ErinAndrews,"Me: ""An apron is what you wear when you cook."" Leta: ""Then why do you have one?"""
ErinAndrews,Jon must narrate Macworld out loud. This habit of his is right up there with owning footwear made for gnomes.
ErinAndrews,"If Twitter replies are any indication, an alarming number of people really do think they're going to see The Curious Case of Benjamin Bratt."
ErinAndrews,Turns out it's a bit of a disappointment if you thought you were going to see The Curious Case of Benjamin Bratt.

Me: ""What if it's a boy?"" 
Leta: ""Um... I'll scream."""

ErinAndrews,"Makes me so proud that a crowd that big in Chicago has gathered for something more important than a pro sports game. Awesome, America."
ErinAndrews,"Pennsylvania, I'd totally kiss you with tongue."
ErinAndrews,Right now Twitter is making me feel like I just went on an Adderall binge.
ErinAndrews,Note: it is certainly not too early to start drinking.
ErinAndrews,Attn. McCain supporters: I already voted. Send those desperate emails to your granny instead.
ErinAndrews,Second attempt at early voting: success!
ErinAndrews,"Scratch that, line so long we could not find the end if it."
ErinAndrews,Off to vote early!
ErinAndrews,"Attn. New York: my dinner date just cancelled, where can I get something good to eat near Times Square by myself?"

ErinAndrews,"Just walked through security at SLC while wearing an Obama '08 shirt, and they didn't search me! Don't they know we're always carrying weed?"
ErinAndrews,It's. Snowing.
ErinAndrews,I hope that whoever the next president is can help us overcome this divide: http://tinyurl.com/3hhwyv
ErinAndrews,Interesting how some people say that we consider Obama to be a divine savior when all we ever said was that he's reasonable.

ErinAndrews,"Unnerving development: I just chose to watch CNN over an episode of ""Access Hollywood."""
ErinAndrews,ZOMG! Leta just demanded that we put her to bed. At 5:42 PM. You go right ahead and twist my arm.
ErinAndrews,I think I'd have a hard time negotiating with this one: http://tinyurl.com/4qjtk7

ErinAndrews,"That awful, ear-splitting noise you just heard? That was Coco seeing Jon for the first time in five days."
ErinAndrews,"Just did some work at the Humane Society, and it was like a three-hour game of tackle football where the goal is to out-cuddle the opponent."
ErinAndrews,Just got stung by a bee in the neck and am slowly starting to resemble a linebacker with small boobs.
ErinAndrews,"""Sex on Fire"" is on the radio in the car right now, and yeah, I'm actually humping the dashboard. It's not that bad a lay."
ErinAndrews,Trying to convince Jon that in fact we DO need an emergency Etsy fund.
ErinAndrews,"Whenever someone calls me ""douche"" in a hatemail, I always want to ask them how on earth they ever came up with something so original."
ErinAndrews,"Today was one of those days where if you asked me if I recommend having kids I'd answer, ""What is your threshold for pain?"""
ErinAndrews,I probably should have pointed out that for every hateful comment left on my post about politics I'm donating a dollar to Obama. Oopsies!
ErinAndrews,Ratio of misspelled words to correctly spelled words in my inbox today: I don't think a number exists this high - to - one.
ErinAndrews,Aaaaaaand... it just got weirder.
ErinAndrews,"Today could not possibly get any weirder, although those are probably famous last words."
ErinAndrews,Leta: I don't want you to brush my hair. Me: Why? Leta: Because it's cold outside. Me: That doesn't make sense. Leta: It doesn't need to.
ErinAndrews,Headed to Labor Day lunch with my Republican family. Told Jon I would fucking deck him if he so much as whispered the word Palin.
ErinAndrews,"Another day, another airplane. Current mood: permanently jetlagged."
ErinAndrews,"Internet, I am not pregnant. Just trying to point out that Mythbusters is basically Jackass with a graduate degree."

ErinAndrews,OMG Leta is eating pancakes for the first time. NO ONE BREATHE.
ErinAndrews,Just saw a guy on a scooter leaving the grocery store with two heaping bags of groceries in his lap. Really hoping he bought eggs.
ErinAndrews,"Got a txt message that ended with, ""From your good friend."" Oddly the txt didn't ask me if I had ever heard about these phones without wires"
ErinAndrews,"Long night spent being kicked in the head by my husband's daughter, and then at 4 AM she's all, can we play now?"
ErinAndrews,"Power is out, and the light from the iPhone is making Jon squint in pain."
ErinAndrews,"Ask yourself: if you act on the urge to send someone a hateful tweet, don't you think it's time to extract that three-week old tampon?"
ErinAndrews,"Up to my eyeballs in dooce.com administrative work. It's not all pajamas and bacon in here, people."

ErinAndrews,Merlin Mann is the Ryan Seacrest of the Internet.

ErinAndrews,Moment of weakness. Want nothing more than a plate of sushi right now.

ErinAndrews,WORST HEADACHE OF MY LIFE.
ErinAndrews,"Hi, Houston. It's been a week, but you're still damn sexy."
ErinAndrews,"Turns out your skull requires sunblock, too. I am your resident skin cancer guinea pig."
ErinAndrews,"Nine hours behind schedule, but we made it to Destin, FL. WORTH IT."
ErinAndrews,Forgotten how adorable it is that people in Alabama love to strap furniture to the top of their car.
ErinAndrews,"Stuck in Houston, being re- routed through Mobile. Hello, Alabama!"
ErinAndrews,"Gulf of Mexico, here we come!"
ErinAndrews,"I put a dress on Leta, she primps for a second and says, ""My kids at school are going to LOVE this."""

ErinAndrews,This morning was the first time I have heard thunder in three years.
ErinAndrews,I slept through the night!
ErinAndrews,The airline industry is broken.

ErinAndrews,Playing princess games on Mama's computer. It is as thrilling as it sounds.
ErinAndrews,I have sent more email in the last hour than I have in the last 10 years of my life. That's like two whole emails.
ErinAndrews,READY TO KILL MY PUBLISHER. SLOWLY. PREFERABLY WITH MY BARE HANDS.
ErinAndrews,P.S. Jon was once a Mormon missionary. Awwwww yeahhhh.

ErinAndrews,"Jon: There is a huge Chinese population in China. Me: Who would  have guessed! Jon: I mean, San Francisco, oh shut up MISS CRAYOLA CROWN."
ErinAndrews,I didn't want to but they forced me to say poop on live TV. I can feel Maggie gagging from here.
ErinAndrews,"Hoping I can sneak out of the house quietly enough that Bo doesn't hear me, ROO! unexpectedly and wake Jon up with a seizure. Tippy-toes!"
ErinAndrews,"Tomorrow morning I'm going to be on the local news, and I can't decide whether or not I should wear any pants."
ErinAndrews,"If you're not delighting in the fact that everything is staged, then you're missing the whole point of reality programming."
ErinAndrews,You go right ahead and exercise your demons. But you might want to take it a step further and ask them to cut back on carbs.
